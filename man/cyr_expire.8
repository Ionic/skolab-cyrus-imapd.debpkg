.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBcyr_expire\fP is used to run a number of regular maintenance tasks
on Cyrus databases, specifically:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
expire messages from mailboxes, and
.IP \(bu 2
expire entries from the duplicate delivery database, and
.IP \(bu 2
cleanse mailboxes of partially expunged messages (when using the “delayed” expunge mode), and
.IP \(bu 2
remove deleted mailboxes (when using the “delayed” delete mode), and
.IP \(bu 2
expire entries from conversations databases, and
.IP \(bu 2
archive messages from mailbox.
.UNINDENT
.sp
There are various annotations that \fBcyr_expire\fP respects:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus\-imapd/expire\fP which controls the expirations of
messages
.IP \(bu 2
\fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus\-imapd/archive\fP which controls the archival of
messages
.IP \(bu 2
\fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus\-imapd/delete\fP which controls the deletion of
messages
.UNINDENT
.sp
These mailbox annotations specify the age(in days) of messages in the
given mailbox that should be expired/archived/deleted.
.sp
The value of the \fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus\-imapd/expire\fP annotation is
inherited by all children of the mailbox on which it is set, so an
entire mailbox tree can be configured by setting a single annotation on
the root of that tree.  If a mailbox does not have a
\fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus\-imapd/expire\fP annotation set on it (or does not
inherit one), then no messages are expired from the mailbox.
.sp
The annotation can be examined using the \fBinfo\fP command of
cyradm(8), and modified using the \fBmboxconfig\fP and
\fBsetinfo\fP commands of cyradm(8)\&.
.sp
Expiration of duplicate delivery database entries for a given mailbox
is also controlled by the \fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus\-imapd/expire\fP annotation
which applies to that mailbox.  A value of 0 on the annotation means
that no expiration is to be performed on that mailbox. Unlike message expiration, if no
annotation applies to the mailbox then duplicate database entries are
expired using the value given to the \fB\-E\fP option.
.sp
Expiration of conversations database entries occurs if the
\fBconversations\fP option is present in imapd.conf(5)\&.
Expiration can be disabled using the \fB\-c\fP option.  The period used to
expire entries is controlled by the \fBconversations_expire_days\fP
option in imapd.conf(5)\&.
.sp
\fBcyr_expire\fP reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by \fB\-C\fP\&.
.sp
\fBcyr_expire\fP requires at least one of \fB\-A \-D \-E \-X\fP or \fB\-t\fP to be
supplied.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C config\-file
Use the specified configuration file \fIconfig\-file\fP rather than the default imapd.conf(5)\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-A archive\-duration
Archive non\-flagged messages older than \fIarchive\-duration\fP to the
archive partition, allowing mailbox messages to be split between fast
storage and slow large storage.  Only does anything if
\fBarchivepartition\-*\fP has been set in your config.
This value is only used for entries which do not have a
corresponding \fB/vendonr/cmu/cyrus\-imapd/archive\fP mailbox annotation.
.sp
This feature was introduced in version 3.0.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-D delete\-duration
Remove previously deleted mailboxes older than \fIdelete\-duration\fP
(when using the “delayed” delete mode).
The value can be a floating point number, and may have a suffix to
specify the unit of time.  If no suffix, the value is number of days.
Valid suffixes are \fBd\fP (days), \fBh\fP (hours), \fBm\fP (minutes) and
\fBs\fP (seconds).
This value is only used for entries which do not have a
corresponding \fB/verdor/cmu/cyrus\-imapd/delete\fP mailbox annotation.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-E expire\-duration
Prune the duplicate database of entries older than \fIexpire\-duration\fP\&.
This value is only used for entries which do not have a corresponding
\fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus\-imapd/expire\fP mailbox annotation.
Format is the same as delete\-duration.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-X expunge\-duration
Expunge previously deleted messages older than \fIexpunge\-duration\fP
(when using the “delayed” expunge mode).
Format is the same as delete\-duration.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c
Do not expire conversation database entries, even if the conversations
feature is enabled.
.sp
This feature was introduced in version 3.0.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-x
Do not expunge messages even if using delayed expunge mode.  This
reduces IO traffic considerably, allowing \fBcyr_expire\fP to be run
frequently to clean up the duplicate database without overloading
the machine.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p mailbox\-prefix
Only find mailboxes starting with this prefix,  e.g.
“user.justgotspammedlots”.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-u userid
Only find mailboxes belonging to this user,  e.g.
“\fI\%justgotspammedlots@example.com\fP”.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t
Remove any user flags which are not used by remaining (not expunged)
messages.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v
Enable verbose output.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a
Skip the annotation lookup, so all \fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus\-imapd/expire\fP
annotations are ignored entirely.  It behaves as if they were not
set, so only \fIexpire\-days\fP is considered for all mailboxes.
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Purge duplicates database of all entries older than \fI3\fP days, remove
deleted mailboxes older than \fI60\fP days and deleted messages older than
\fI60\fP days.

\fBcyr_expire \-x \-c \-A\fP \fI7d\fP

partition whilst not altering conversation database nor
expunging messages.
