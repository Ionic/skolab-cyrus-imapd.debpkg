.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBsync_client\fP is the client side of the replication system.  It runs
on the client (master) system and connects to the target (replica)
system and generates an appropriate sequence of transactions to
synchronize the replica system with the master system.
.sp
\fBsync_client\fP reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by \fB\-C\fP\&.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C config\-file
Use the specified configuration file \fIconfig\-file\fP rather than the default imapd.conf(5)\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-A
All users mode.
Sync every user on the server to the replica (doesn\(aqt do non\-user
mailboxes at all... this could be considered a bug and maybe it
should do those mailboxes independently)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d delay
Minimum delay between replication runs in rolling replication mode.
Larger values provide better efficiency as transactions can be
merged. Smaller values mean that the replica system is more up to
date and that you don\(aqt end up with large blocks of replication
transactions as a single group. Default: 3 seconds.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f input\-file
In mailbox or user replication mode: provides list of users or
mailboxes to replicate.  In rolling replication mode, specifies an
alternate log file (\fBsync_client\fP will exit after processing the
log file).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-F shutdown\-file
Rolling replication checks for this file at the end of each
replication cycle and shuts down if it is present. Used to request
a nice clean shutdown at the first convenient point. The file is
removed on shutdown. Overrides \fBsync_shutdown_file\fP option in
imapd.conf(5)\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-l
Verbose logging mode.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-L
Perform only local mailbox operations (do not do mupdate operations).
This feature was introduced in version 3.0.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-m
Mailbox mode.
Remaining arguments are list of mailboxes which should be replicated.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-n channel
Use the named channel for rolling replication mode.  If multiple
channels are specified in \fBsync_log_channels\fP then use one of them.
This option is probably best combined with \fB\-S\fP to connect to a
different server with each channel.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-o
Only attempt to connect to the backend server once rather than
waiting up to 1000 seconds before giving up.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-O
No copyback mode. Replication will stop if the replica reports a CRC
error, rather than doing a full mailbox sync. Useful if moving users to a
new server, where you don\(aqt want any errors to cause the source servers
to change the account.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p partition
In mailbox or user replication mode: provides the name of the
partition on the replica to which the mailboxes/users should be
replicated.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-r
Rolling (repeat) replication mode. Pick up a list of actions
recorded by the lmtpd(8), imapd(8),
pop3d(8) and nntpd(8) daemons from the file
specified in \fBsync_log_file\fP\&. Repeat until \fBsync_shutdown_file\fP
appears.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s
Sieve mode.
Remaining arguments are list of users whose Sieve files should be
replicated. Principally used for debugging purposes: not exposed to
\fI\%sync_client(8)\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-S servername
Tells \fBsync_client\fP with which server to communicate.  Overrides
the \fBsync_host\fP configuration option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t timeout
Timeout for single replication run in rolling replication.
\fBsync_client\fP will negotiate a restart after this many seconds.
Default: 600 seconds
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-u
User mode.
Remaining arguments are list of users who should be replicated.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.  Use twice (\fB\-v \-v\fP) to log all protocol traffic to
stderr.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-w interval
Wait this long before starting. This option is typically used so
that we can attach a debugger to one end of the replication system
or the other.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-z
Require compression.
The replication protocol will always try to enable deflate
compression if both ends support it.  Set this flag when you want
to abort if compression is not available.
.UNINDENT

On a replication master, the following would be added to the START
section of cyrus.conf(5):
