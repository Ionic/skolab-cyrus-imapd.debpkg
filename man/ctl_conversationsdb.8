.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBctl_conversationsdb\fP is used to perform various administrative
operations on a conversations database and associated information in
\fIcyrus.index\fP files.
.sp
\fBctl_conversationsdb\fP reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by \fB\-C\fP\&.
.sp
The \fIconfigdirectory\fP option in imapd.conf(5) is used to determine the default location of the conversations database.
.sp
In the first synopsis, the \fB\-d\fP option dumps the contents of a
conversations database to standard output in an ASCII format.  In the
second synopsis, the resulting \fIfile\fP is fed back in, using the
\fB\-u\fP option to "undump" from standard input.  This pair of commands
is useful for disaster recovery, or for changing the backend used to
store the conversations database.
.sp
The third synopsis is used to reconstruct conversations information
in various ways for a specific user, and the fourth to reconstruct
conversations information for all users.  See \fBOPTIONS\fP below for
details.
.sp
This command was introduced in version 3.0.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C config\-file
Use the specified configuration file \fIconfig\-file\fP rather than the default imapd.conf(5)\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d userid
Dump the conversations database which corresponds to the user \fIuserid\fP
to standard output in an ASCII format.  The resulting file can be
used to recreate a database using the \fB\-u\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-u userid
"Undumps" the conversations database corresponding to the user \fIuserid\fP,
i.e. replaces all the entries with data from ASCII records parsed
from standard input.  The output from the \fB\-d\fP option can be used
as input.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v
Be more verbose when running.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-r
Be recursive; apply the main operation to every user.  Warning: do
not combine with \fB\-u\fP, it will not do what you expect.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-z
Remove all conversation information from the conversations database
for user \fIuserid\fP, and from all the user\(aqs mailboxes.  The
information can all be recalculated (eventually) from message
headers, using the \fB\-b\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b
Rebuild all conversation information in the conversations database
for user \fIuserid\fP, and in all the user\(aqs mailboxes, from the header
information in messages.  Does not affect messages which already
have conversation information.
.sp
This is a bulk mode version of what happens to each message when it
arrives, and can be used to add missing conversation information
for past messages, e.g. after using \fB\-z\fP or after upgrading
Cyrus from older versions.  Note: this operation uses information
from \fIcyrus.cache\fP files so it does not need to read every single
message file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-R
Recalculate counts of messages stored in existing conversations in
the conversations database for user \fIuserid\fP\&.  This is a limited
subset of \fB\-b\fP; in particular it does not create conversations or
assign messages to conversations.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-S
If given with \fB\-b\fP, allows splitting of conversations during the
rewrite.   Only do this is changing the maximum conversation size
and you need to split those existing conversations.
