.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBctl_backups\fP is a tool for performing administrative operations on Cyrus
backups.
.sp
\fBctl_backups\fP reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by \fB\-C\fP\&.
.sp
In all invocations, \fIbackup\fP is interpreted according to the specified MODE.
See \fI\%Modes\fP below.
.sp
\fBctl_backups\fP provides the following sub\-commands:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B compact
Reduce storage required by the named backups.  Compact behaviour is
influenced by the \fBbackup_compact_minsize\fP, \fBbackup_compact_maxsize\fP,
\fBbackup_compact_work_threshold\fP, and \fBbackup_retention_days\fP
configuration settings.  See imapd.conf(5) for details.
.sp
This should generally be invoked regularly, such as by adding an
entry to the EVENTS section of cyrus.conf(5)\&.  See
\fI\%Examples\fP for an example.
.sp
If the \fBbackup_keep_previous\fP configuration setting is enabled,
compact will preserve the original data and index files (renaming
them with a timestamp).  This is useful for debugging.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B list
List backups.  See \fI\%List Options\fP for options specific
to the \fBlist\fP sub\-command.  Columns are separated by tabs, and are:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
end time of latest chunk
.IP \(bu 2
size of backup data file on disk
.IP \(bu 2
userid to which the backup belongs
.IP \(bu 2
path to backup data file
.UNINDENT
.sp
If no \fI\%mode\fP or backups are specified, lists all
known backups (as if invoked with the \fB\-A\fP mode).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B lock
Obtain and hold a lock on the named backup.  Useful for operating on
Cyrus backup files using non\-Cyrus tools (such as UNIX tools or custom
scripts) in relative safety.  See \fI\%Lock Options\fP for details.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B reindex
Rebuild the indexes for the named backups, based on the raw backup data.
This is useful if their index files have been corrupted, or if the index
format has changed.
.sp
If the \fBbackup_keep_previous\fP configuration setting is enabled,
reindex will preserve the original index file (renaming it with a
timestamp).  This is useful for debugging.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B stat
Display stats for the named backups.  Columns are separated by tabs, and
are:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
userid or filename
.IP \(bu 2
compressed (i.e. on disk) size
.IP \(bu 2
uncompressed size
.IP \(bu 2
compactable size
.IP \(bu 2
compression ratio
.IP \(bu 2
utilisation ratio
.IP \(bu 2
start time of latest chunk
.IP \(bu 2
end time of latest chunk
.UNINDENT
.sp
The compactable size is an approximation of how much uncompressed data would
remain after \fBcompact\fP is performed.  The utilisation ratio is this figure
expressed as a percentage of the uncompressed size.  Note that this
approximation is an underestimate.  That is to say, a backup that has just
been compacted will probably still report less than 100% utilisation.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B verify
Verify consistency of the named backups by performing deep checks on both
the raw backup data and its index.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C config\-file
Use the specified configuration file \fIconfig\-file\fP rather than the default imapd.conf(5)\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-F
Force the operation to occur, even if it is determined to be unnecessary.
This is mostly useful with the \fBcompact\fP sub\-command.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-S
Stop\-on\-error.  With this option, if a sub\-command fails for any
particular backup, \fBctl_backups\fP will immediately exit with an error,
without processing further backups.
.sp
The default is to log the error, and continue with the next backup.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-V
Don’t verify backup checksums for read\-only operations.
.sp
The read\-only operations \fBlist\fP and \fBstat\fP will normally perform a
“quick” verification of the backup file being read, which checks the
checksums of the most recent chunk.  This can be slow for backups
whose most recent backup chunk is very large.
.sp
With this option, the verification step will be skipped.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-j
Produce output in JSON format.  The default is plain text.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v
Increase the verbosity.  Can be specified multiple times.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-w
Wait for locks.  With this option, if a backup named on the command line is
locked, execution will block until the lock becomes available.
.sp
The default is to skip backups that are currently locked.
.UNINDENT
.SH LIST OPTIONS
.sp
Options that apply only to the \fBlist\fP sub\-command.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t [hours]
List stale backups only, that is, backups that have received no updates
in \fIhours\fP\&.  If \fIhours\fP is unspecified, it defaults to 24.
.UNINDENT
.SH LOCK OPTIONS
.sp
Options that apply only to the \fBlock\fP sub\-command.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c
Exclusively create the named backup while obtaining the lock.  Exits
immediately with an error if the named backup already exists.
.sp
When the lock is successfully obtained, continue as per the other options.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p
Locks the named backup, and then waits for EOF on the standard input
stream.  Unlocks the backup and exits once EOF is received.  This is the
default mode of operation.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s
Locks the named backup, and with the lock held, opens its index file in
the \fBsqlite3(1)\fP program.  The lock is automatically released when
sqlite3 exits.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-x command
Locks the named backup, and with the lock held, executes \fIcommand\fP using
\fB/bin/sh\fP (as per \fBsystem(3)\fP).  The lock is automatically
released when \fIcommand\fP completes.
.sp
The filenames of the backup data and index are made available to \fIcommand\fP
in the environment variables \fB$ctl_backups_lock_data_fname\fP and
\fB$ctl_backups_lock_index_fname\fP, respectively.
.UNINDENT
.SH MODES
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-A
Run sub\-command over all known backups.
.sp
Known backups are recorded in the database specified by the \fBbackup_db\fP
and \fBbackup_db_path\fP configuration options.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-D
Backups specified on the command line are interpreted as domains.  Run
sub\-command over known backups for users in these domains.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-P
Backups specified on the command line are interpreted as userid prefixes.
Run sub\-command over known backups for users matching these prefixes.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f
Backups specified on the command line are interpreted as filenames.  Run
sub\-command over the matching backup files.  The backup files do not need
to be known about in the backups database.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-m
Backups specified on the command line are interpreted as mailbox names.
Run sub\-command over known backups containing these mailboxes.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-u
Backups specified on the command line are interpreted as userids.  Run
sub\-command over known backups for matching users.
.sp
This is the default if no mode is specified.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXAMPLES
