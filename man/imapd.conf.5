IMAP configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fB/etc/imapd.conf\fP
is the configuration file for the Cyrus IMAP server.  It defines
local parameters for IMAP.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
Each line of the \fB/etc/imapd.conf\fP file has the form
\fIoption\fP: \fIvalue\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
where \fIoption\fP is the name of the configuration option being set
and \fIvalue\fP is the value that the configuration option is being
set to.
.sp
Although there is no limit to the length of a line, a \(ga\(ga\(aq’
(backslash) character may be used as the last character on a line to
force it to continue on the next one.  No additional whitespace is
inserted before or after the \(ga\(ga\(aq’.  Note that a line that is split
using \(ga\(ga\(aq’ character(s) is still considered a single line.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B For example
\fIoption\fP:\e
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fIvalue\fP1 \fIvalue\fP2 \e
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fIvalue\fP3
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B is equivalent to
\fIoption\fP: \fIvalue\fP1 \fIvalue\fP2   \fIvalue\fP3
.UNINDENT
.sp
Blank lines and lines beginning with \(ga\(ga#’’ are ignored.
.sp
For boolean and enumerated options, the values \(ga\(gayes’‘, \(ga\(gaon’‘, \(ga\(gat’‘,
\(ga\(gatrue’’ and \(ga\(ga1’’ turn the option on, the values \(ga\(gano’‘, \(ga\(gaoff’‘,
\(ga\(gaf’‘, \(ga\(gafalse’’ and \(ga\(ga0’’ turn the option off.
.sp
Duration options take the form of a number followed by a unit, for example
\fB32m\fP (32 minutes).  Units are \fBd\fP (days), \fBh\fP (hours), \fBm\fP
(minutes) and \fBs\fP (seconds).  Multiple units can be combined and will
be summed together, for example \fB1h30m\fP is equivalent to \fB90m\fP\&.  If
no unit is specified, an option\-specific backward\-compatible default unit
is assumed (documented on an option\-by\-option basis).  These are simple time
units: 1d=24h, 1h=60m, 1m=60s (daylight savings, timezones, leap adjustments,
etc are not considered).
.UNINDENT

.SH FIELD DESCRIPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The sections below detail options that can be placed in the
\fB/etc/imapd.conf\fP file, and show each option’s default value.
Some options have no default value, these are listed with
\(ga\(ga<no default>’‘.  Some options default to the empty string, these
are listed with \(ga\(ga<none>’‘.
.sp
\fBacl_admin_implies_write:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If enabled, any user with the admin ACL on a mailbox implicitly
gets the ability to write to that mailbox as well.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBaddressbookprefix:\fP #addressbooks
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The prefix for the addressbook mailboxes hierarchies.  The hierarchy
delimiter will be automatically appended.  The public addressbook
hierarchy will be at the toplevel of the shared namespace.  A
user’s personal addressbook hierarchy will be a child of their Inbox.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBadmins:\fP <empty string>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The list of userids with administrative rights.  Separate each userid
with a space.  Sites using Kerberos authentication may use
separate “admin” instances.
.sp
Note that accounts used by users should not be administrators.
Administrative accounts should not receive mail.  That is, if user
“jbRo” is a user reading mail, he should not also be in the admins line.
Some problems may occur otherwise, most notably the ability of
administrators to create top\-level mailboxes visible to users,
but not writable by users.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBafspts_localrealms:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The list of realms which are to be treated as local, and thus stripped
during identifier canonicalization (for the AFSPTS ptloader module).
This is different from loginrealms in that it occurs later in the
authorization process (as the user id is canonified for PTS lookup)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBafspts_mycell:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Cell to use for AFS PTS lookups.  Defaults to the local cell.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBallowallsubscribe:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Allow subscription to nonexistent mailboxes.  This option is
typically used on backend servers in a Murder so that users can
subscribe to mailboxes that don’t reside on their “home” server.
This option can also be used as a workaround for IMAP clients which
don’t play well with nonexistent or unselectable mailboxes (e.g.,
Microsoft Outlook).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBallowanonymouslogin:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Permit logins by the user “anonymous” using any password.  Also
allows use of the SASL ANONYMOUS mechanism.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBallowapop:\fP 1
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Allow use of the POP3 APOP authentication command.
.sp
Note that this command requires that SASL is compiled with APOP
support, that the plaintext passwords are available in a SASL auxprop
backend (e.g., sasldb), and that the system can provide enough entropy
(e.g., from /dev/urandom) to create a challenge in the banner.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBallowdeleted:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Allow access to deleted and expunged data via vendor.cmu\-* access
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBallownewnews:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Allow use of the NNTP NEWNEWS command.
.sp
Note that this is a very expensive command and should only be
enabled when absolutely necessary.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBallowplaintext:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If enabled, allows the use of cleartext passwords on the wire.
.sp
By default, the use of cleartext passwords requires a TLS/SSL
encryption layer to be negotiated prior to any cleartext
authentication mechanisms being advertised or allowed.  To require a
TLS/SSL encryption layer to be negotiated prior to ANY
authentication, see the \fItls_required\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBallowsetacl:\fP 1
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Defaults to enabled.  If disabled, disallows the use of the SETACL
command at all via IMAP.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBallowusermoves:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Allow moving user accounts (with associated meta\-data) via RENAME
or XFER.
.sp
Note that measures should be taken to make sure that the user being
moved is not logged in, and cannot login during the move.  Failure
to do so may result in the user’s meta\-data (seen state,
subscriptions, etc) being corrupted or out of date.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBaltnamespace:\fP 1
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use the alternate IMAP namespace, where personal folders reside at the
same level in the hierarchy as INBOX.
.sp
This option ONLY applies where interaction takes place with the
client/user.  Currently this is limited to the IMAP protocol (imapd)
and Sieve scripts (lmtpd).  This option does NOT apply to admin tools
such as cyradm (admins ONLY), reconstruct, quota, etc., NOR does it
affect LMTP delivery of messages directly to mailboxes via
plus\-addressing.  The default changed in 3.0 from off to on.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBaltprefix:\fP Alt Folders
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Alternative INBOX spellings that can’t be accessed in altnamespace
otherwise go under here
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBannotation_db:\fP twoskip
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The cyrusdb backend to use for mailbox annotations.
.sp
Allowed values: \fIskiplist\fP, \fItwoskip\fP, \fIzeroskip\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBannotation_db_path:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The absolute path to the annotations db file.  If not specified,
will be configdirectory/annotations.db
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBanyoneuseracl:\fP 1
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Should non\-admin users be allowed to set ACLs for the ‘anyone’
user on their mailboxes?  In a large organization this can cause
support problems, but it’s enabled by default.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBannotation_allow_undefined:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Allow clients to store values for entries which are not
defined either by Cyrus or in the annotations_definitions
file.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBannotation_definitions:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
File containing external (third\-party) annotation definitions.
.sp
Each line of the file specifies the properties of an annotation and
has the following form:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fIname\fP, \fIscope\fP, \fIattrib\-type\fP, \fIproxy\-type\fP,
\fIattrib\-names\fP, \fIacl\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fIname\fP
is the hierarchical name as in \fI\%RFC 5257\fP or \fI\%RFC 5464\fP (in the latter case,
without the leading \fB/shared\fP or \fB/private\fP).  For example,
/vendor/acme/blurdybloop.
.TP
.B \fIscope\fP
specifies whether the annotation is for the \fBserver\fP, a
\fBmailbox\fP, or a \fBmessage\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fIattrib\-type\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
specifies the attribute data type, which is used only to check the
string value passed by clients when setting annotations.  The
\fIattrib\-type\fP is one of:
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
\fBstring\fP
any value is accepted.
.TP
\fBcontent\-type\fP
this obsolete data type, which was useful for early drafts of the standard,
is accepted but silently translated to \fBstring\fP\&.
.TP
\fBboolean\fP
only the strings “true” or “false” are accepted.  Checking is
case\-insensitive but the value is forced to lowercase.
.TP
\fBint\fP
integers are accepted.
.TP
\fBuint\fP
non\-negative integers are accepted.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fIproxy\-type\fP
specifies whether this attribute is for the \fBbackend\fP or
\fBproxy\fP servers or both (\fBproxy_and_backend\fP)
.TP
.B \fIattrib\-names\fP
is the space\-separated list of available attributes for the
annotation. Possible attribute names are \fBvalue.shared\fP,
\fBvalue.priv\fP, and \fBvalue\fP (which permits both \fBvalue.priv\fP
and \fBvalue.shared\fP).  The attribute names \fBsize\fP,
\fBsize.shared\fP, and \fBsize.priv\fP are accepted but ignored; these
attributes are automatically provided by the server if the corresponding
\fBvalue\fP attribute is specified.  Some obsolete attributes, which were
defined early drafts of the standard, are accepted and ignored with a
warning.
.TP
.B \fIextra\-permissions\fP
is the extra ACL permission bits required for setting this annotation, in
standard IMAP ACL permission bit string format.  Note that this is
in addition to the permission bits specified in \fI\%RFC 5257\fP and \fI\%RFC 5464\fP,
so leaving this field empty is harmless.  Note also that there is no way
to specify that an annotation can only be set by an admin user; in
particular the \fBa\fP permission bit does not achieve this.
.sp
Blank lines and lines beginning with \(ga\(ga#’’ are ignored.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBannotation_callout:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The pathname of a callout to be used to automatically add annotations
or flags to a message when it is appended to a mailbox.  The path can
be either an executable (including a script), or a UNIX domain
socket.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBannotation_callout_disable_append:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Disables annotations on append with xrunannotator
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBannotation_enable_legacy_commands:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Whether to enable the legacy GETANNOTATION/SETANNOTATION commands.
These commands are deprecated and will be removed in the future,
but might be useful in the meantime for supporting old clients that
do not implement the \fI\%RFC 5464\fP IMAP METADATA extension.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBaps_topic:\fP <none>

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBarchive_enabled:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Is archiving enabled for this server.  You also need to have an
archivepartition for the mailbox.  Archiving allows older email
to be stored on slower, cheaper disks \- even within the same
mailbox, as distinct from partitions.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBarchive_days:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Deprecated in favour of \fIarchive_after\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBarchive_after:\fP 7d
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The duration after which to move messages to the archive partition
if archiving is enabled.
.sp
For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, days is
assumed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBarchive_maxsize:\fP 1024
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The size in kilobytes of the largest message that won’t be archived
immediately.  Default is 1Mb
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBarchive_keepflagged:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If set, messages with the \eFlagged system flag won’t be archived,
provided they are smaller than \fBarchive_maxsize\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBarchivepartition\-name:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The pathname of the archive partition \fIname\fP, corresponding to
spool partition \fBpartition\-name\fP\&.  For any mailbox residing in
a directory on \fBpartition\-name\fP, the archived messages will be
stored in a corresponding directory on \fBarchivepartition\-name\fP\&.
Note that not every \fBpartition\-name\fP option is strictly required
to have a corresponding \fBarchivepartition\-name\fP option, but that
without one there’s no benefit to enabling archiving.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBauditlog:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Should cyrus output log entries for every action taken on a message
file or mailboxes list entry?  It’s noisy so disabled by default, but
can be very useful for tracking down what happened if things look strange
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBauth_mech:\fP unix
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBautocreate_acl:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If folders are to be created by \fIautocreate_inbox_folders\fP, this
setting can be used to apply additional ACLs to the autocreated
folders.  The syntax is “autocreate_acl folder identifier rights”,
where \fIfolder\fP must match one of the \fIautocreate_inbox_folders\fP
folders, \fIidentifier\fP must be a valid cyrus identifier, and
\fIrights\fP must be a valid cyrus rights string.  Multiple
identifier|rights pairs can be assigned to a single folder by providing
this setting multiple times.
.sp
For example, “autocreate_acl Plus anyone p” would allow lmtp delivery
to a folder named “Plus”.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBautocreate_inbox_folders:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If a user does not have an INBOX already, and the INBOX is to be
created, create the list of folders in this setting as well.
\fIautocreate_inbox_folders\fP is a list of INBOX’s subfolders
separated by a “|”, that are automatically created by the server
under the following two scenarios. Leading and trailing whitespace is
stripped, so “Junk | Trash” results in two folders: “Junk” and
“Trash”.  See also the \fIxlist\-flag\fP option, for setting
special\-use flags on autocreated folders.
.sp
INBOX folders are created under both the following conditions:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
The user logins via the IMAP or the POP3 protocol.
\fIautocreate_quota\fP option must have a value of zero or greater.
.IP 2. 3
A message arrives for the user through the \fIlmtpd(8)\fP\&.
\fIautocreate_post\fP option must be enabled.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBautocreate_post:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If enabled, when \fIlmtpd(8)\fP receives an incoming mail for an
INBOX that does not exist, then the INBOX is automatically created
by \fIlmtpd(8)\fP and delivery of the message continues.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBautocreate_quota:\fP \-1
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If set to a value of zero or higher, users have their INBOX folders
created upon a successful login event or upon \fIlmtpd(8)\fP
message delivery if \fIautocreate_post\fP is enabled, provided their
INBOX did not yet already exist.
.sp
The user’s quota is set to the value if it is greater than zero,
otherwise the user has unlimited quota.
.sp
Note that quota is specified in kilobytes.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBautocreate_quota_messages:\fP \-1
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If set to a value of zero or higher, users who have their INBOX
folders created upon a successful login event (see
\fIautocreate_quota\fP), or upon \fIlmtpd(8)\fP message delivery if
\fIautocreate_post\fP is enabled, receive the message quota
configured in this option.
.sp
The default of \-1 disables assigning message quota.
.sp
For consistency with \fIautocreate_quota\fP, a value of zero is treated
as unlimited message quota, rather than a message quota of zero.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBautocreate_sieve_folders:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A “|” separated list of subfolders of INBOX that will be
automatically created, if requested by a sieve filter, through the
“fileinto” action. The default is to create no folders
automatically.
.sp
Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from each folder, so a
setting of “Junk | Trash” will create two folders: “Junk” and
“Trash”.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBautocreate_sieve_script:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The full path of a file that contains a sieve script. This script
automatically becomes a user’s initial default sieve filter script.
.sp
When this option is not defined, no default sieve filter is created.
The file must be readable by the Cyrus daemon.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBautocreate_sieve_script_compile:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If set to yes and no compiled sieve script file exists, the sieve script which is
compiled on the fly will be saved in the file name that autocreate_sieve_compiledscript
option points to. In order a compiled script to be generated, autocreate_sieve_script and
autocreate_sieve_compiledscript must have valid values
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBautocreate_sieve_script_compiled:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The full path of a file that contains a compiled in bytecode sieve script. This script
automatically becomes a user’s initial default sieve filter script.  If this option is
not specified, or the filename doesn’t exist then the script defined by
autocreate_sieve_script is compiled on the fly and installed as the user’s default
sieve script
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBautocreate_subscribe_folders:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of folder names, separated by “|”, that the users get automatically subscribed to,
when their INBOX is created. These folder names must have been included in the
autocreateinboxfolders option of the imapd.conf.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBautocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A list of shared folders (bulletin boards), separated by “|”, that the users get
automatically subscribed to, after their INBOX is created. The shared folder must
have been created and the user must have the required permissions to get subscribed
to it. Otherwise, subscribing to the shared folder fails.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBautocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders_all:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If set to yes, the user is automatically subscribed to all shared folders, one has permission
to subscribe to.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBautocreate_users:\fP anyone
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A space separated list of users and/or groups that are allowed their INBOX to be
automatically created.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBautoexpunge:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If set to yes, then all Deleted messages will be automatically expunged whenever
an index is closed, whether CLOSE, UNSELECT, SELECT or on disconnect
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBbackuppartition\-name:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The pathname of the backup partition \fIname\fP\&.  At least one backup
partition pathname MUST be specified if backups are in use.  Note that
there is no relationship between spool partitions and backup partitions.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBbackup_compact_minsize:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The minimum size in kilobytes of chunks in each backup.  The compact tool
will try to combine adjacent chunks that are smaller than this.
.sp
Setting this value to zero or negative disables combining of chunks.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBbackup_compact_maxsize:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The maximum size in kilobytes of chunks in each backup.  The compact tool

The mode in which messages (and their corresponding cache entries)

message files are purged at the time of the EXPUNGE, but index
and cache records are retained to facilitate QRESYNC.
In “delayed” mode, which is the default since Cyrus 2.5.0,
the message files are also retained, allowing unexpunge to
rescue them.  In “immediate” mode, both the message files and the
index records are removed as soon as possible.  In all cases,
nothing will be finally purged until all other processes have
closed the mailbox to ensure they never see data disappear under
them.  In “semidelayed” or “delayed” mode, a later run of “cyr_expire”
will clean out the retained records (and possibly message files).
This reduces the amount of I/O that takes place at the time of
EXPUNGE and should result in greater responsiveness for the client,
especially when expunging a large number of messages.

A ‘@’ may be used in place of ‘!’ in the wildmat to prevent feeding
articles cross\-posted to the given group, otherwise cross\-posted
articles are fed if any part of the wildmat matches.  For example,
the string “peer.example.com:*,!control.*,@local.*” would feed all

\fBpopexpiretime:\fP \-1
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The duration advertised as being the minimum a message may be
left on the POP server before it is deleted (via the CAPA command,
defined in the POP3 Extension Mechanism, which some clients may
support).  This duration has a granularity of whole days, with partial
days truncated (so e.g. “45m” is effectively “0d”).  “NEVER”, the
default, may be specified with a negative number.
.sp
The Cyrus POP3 server never deletes mail, no matter what the value of
this parameter is.  However, if a site implements a less liberal policy,
it needs to change this parameter accordingly.
.sp
For backward compatibility, if no unit is specified, days is
assumed.

.sp
\fBpoppollpadding:\fP 1
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Create a softer minimum poll restriction.  Allows \fIpoppollpadding\fP
connections before the minpoll restriction is triggered.  Additionally,
one padding entry is recovered every \fIpopminpoll\fP minutes.
This allows for the occasional polling rate faster than popminpoll,
(i.e., for clients that require a send/receive to send mail) but still
enforces the rate long\-term.  Default is 1 (disabled).
.sp
The easiest way to think of it is a queue of past connections, with one
slot being filled for every connection, and one slot being cleared
every \fIpopminpoll\fP minutes. When the queue is full, the user
will not be able to check mail again until a slot is cleared.  If the
user waits a sufficient amount of time, they will get back many or all
of the slots.

\fBpopuseacl:\fP 0
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Enforce IMAP ACLs in the pop server.  Due to the nature of the POP3
protocol, the only rights which are used by the pop server are ‘r’,
‘t’, and ‘s’ for the owner of the mailbox.  The ‘r’ right allows the
user to open the mailbox and list/retrieve messages.  The ‘t’ right
allows the user to delete messages.  The ‘s’ right allows messages
retrieved by the user to have the \eSeen flag set (only if
\fIpopuseimapflags\fP is also enabled).

\fBsearch_attachment_extractor_url:\fP <none>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A HTTP or HTTPS URL to extract search text from rich text attachments
and other media during search indexing. The server at this URL must
implement the following protocol:
.sp
1. For each attachment of an email, Cyrus sends a GET request to the
URL <extractor\-url>/<cyrus\-id>, where <extractor\-url> is the
configured URL and <cyrus\-id> is a Cyrus\-chosen path segment that
uniquely identifies this attachment.
.sp
2. If the extractor already has a cached plain text extract of the
attachment identified by <cyrus\-id> then it may return HTTP status
code 200 (OK) and the plain text extract with a Content\-Type
“text/plain” header. Otherwise it must return HTTP status 404 (Not Found).
.sp
3. If Cyrus receives the HTTP status code 404 (Not Found), then it sends
a PUT request to the same URL as previously. The PUT request body
contains the decoded, binary body of the attachment. The Content\-Type
request header has the same value as declared in the MIME part
headers, including any type parameters.
.sp
4. The extractor must return the plain text extract with either HTTP status
200 (OK) or 201 (Created) and a Content\-Type “text/plain” header.
If no text can be extracted, then the extractor may return any return code
in the range 4xx, or 200 and an empty response body.
.sp
Any other HTTP status code is treated as an error. For performance
reasons, the Cyrus indexer attempts to keep\-alive the TCP connection
to the extractor.
