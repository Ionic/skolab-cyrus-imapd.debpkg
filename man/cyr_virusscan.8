.sp
Scan for viruses using configured virus scanner or manage infected messages using search criteria.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
\fBcyr_virusscan\fP [ \fB\-C\fP \fIconfig\-file\fP ] [ \fB\-s\fP \fIimap\-search\-string\fP ] [ \fB\-r\fP [ \fB\-n\fP] ] [\fB\-v\fP] [ \fImboxpattern1\fP ... ]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBcyr_virusscan\fP can be used to invoke an external virus scanner (currently
only \fI\%ClamAV\fP is
supported) to scan specified IMAP mailboxes. If no mboxpattern is given,
\fBcyr_virusscan\fP works on all mailboxes.
.sp
Alternately, with the \fB\-s\fP option, the IMAP SEARCH string will be used as a
specification of messages which are \fIassumed\fP to be infected, and will be
treated as such.  The virus scanner is not invoked. Useful for removing messages
without a distinct signature, such as Phish.
.sp
A table of infected messages will be output.
.sp
To remove infected messages, use the \fB\-r\fP flag. Infected messages will be expunged
from the user\(aqs mailbox.
.sp
With the notify flag, \fB\-n\fP, notifications will be appended to the inbox of
the mailbox owner, containing message digest information for the affected mail.
This flag only works in combination with \fB\-r\fP\&.  The notification message
can by customised by template, for details see \fI\%Notifications\fP below.
.sp
\fBcyr_virusscan\fP can be configured to run periodically by cron(8)
via crontab(5) or your preferred method (i.e. /etc/cron.hourly), or by
master(8) via the EVENTS{} section in
cyrus.conf(5)\&.
.sp
\fBcyr_virusscan\fP reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by \fB\-C\fP\&.
.sp
Note that Cyrus does not ship with any virus scanners: you need to install
one separately to make use of it with Cyrus.
.SH OPTIONS

.SH NOTIFICATIONS
.sp
When the \fB\-n\fP flag is provided, notifications are sent to mailbox owners
when infected messages are removed.  One notification is sent per owner,
containing a digest of each message that was deleted from any of their
mailboxes.
.sp
The default notification subject is "Automatically deleted mail", which
can be overridden by setting \fBvirusscan_notification_subject\fP in
imapd.conf(5) to a UTF\-8 value.
.sp
Each infected message will be described according to the following template:
.sp
.nf
The following message was deleted from mailbox \(aq%MAILBOX%\(aq
because it was infected with virus \(aq%VIRUS%\(aq

    Message\-ID: %MSG_ID%
    Date: %MSG_DATE%
    From: %MSG_FROM%
    Subject: %MSG_SUBJECT%
    IMAP UID: %MSG_UID%
.fi
.sp
To use a custom template, create a UTF\-8 file containing your desired text
and using the same %\-delimited substitutions as above, and set the
\fBvirusscan_notification_template\fP option in imapd.conf(5) to
its path.
.sp
The notification message will be properly MIME\-encoded at delivery. Do not
pre\-encode the template file or the subject!
.sp
When \fBcyr_virusscan\fP starts up, if notifications have been requested (with
the \fB\-n\fP flag), a basic sanity check of the template will be performed
prior to initialising the antivirus engine.  If it appears that the
resultant notifications would be undeliverable for some reason,
\fBcyr_virusscan\fP will exit immediately with an error, rather than risk
deleting messages without notifying.
