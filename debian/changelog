  [ Sven Mueller ]
  * Added kolab2 annotation patch as proposed by Christoper Sacca
  * Added a small patch to lower the minimum pop3 timeout to 1 minute.
    The default is still at 10 minutes. I also added some documentation to make
    it clear to admins that it is _not_ recommended to lower the value to less
    than 10 minutes (because that is what the standard says it should be at).
    I needed this change for use at my workplace though. The patch is disabled
    by default.
  * Patched init script to support everything LSB 3.0 asks for, including the
    "right" return codes, as far as we can.
  * Add patch to enhance sieveshell a bit:
    - Add --execfile parameter to read commands from a file
    - Add --password parameter to pass the users parameter on the commandline
    - Add code to return with a non-zero exit code if the last command
      executed failed for some reason.
