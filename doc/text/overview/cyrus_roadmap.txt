Cyrus Roadmap
*************

This is a very general, high-level view of where the Cyrus project is
heading in the future, and the amount of code support you may expect
to receive if you're running an older version of Cyrus.

This is under your control! If there's a feature you'd like to see
added, or testing/documentation you'd like to see improved, we'd love
to have your involvement to help make it happen. We're here to support
you. Contact us and take a look at the Contributor guides.
