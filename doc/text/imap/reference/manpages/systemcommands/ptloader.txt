**ptloader**
************

The AFS & LDAP pts server loader service


Synopsis
========

   ptloader [**-d**]


Description
===========

**ptloader** interacts with the authorization service, either AFS or
LDAP, providing group membership information to Cyrus.  When
"auth_mech: pts" is set in imapd.conf(5), **ptloader** will then
consult the backend specified in the "pts_module" setting (currently
either "afs" or "ldap").

**ptloader** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file and *does not* accept the **-C** option.


Options
=======

-d

   Run **ptloader** in debugging mode.


Files
=====

/etc/imapd.conf
