Description
===========

Note: The name "**squatter**" once referred both to the SQUAT
  indexing engine and to the command used to create indexes.  Now that
  Cyrus supports more than one index type -- SQUAT and Xapian, as of
  this writing -- the name "**squatter**" refers to the command used
  to control index creation.  The terms "SQUAT" or "SQUAT index(es)"
  refers to the indexes used by the older SQUAT indexing engine. Post
  v3 the *search_engine* setting in *imapd.conf* determines which
  search engine is used.

**squatter** creates a new text index for one or more IMAP mailboxes.
The index is a unified index of all of the header and body text of
each message in a given mailbox.  This index is used to significantly
reduce IMAP SEARCH times on a mailbox.

**mode** is one of indexer, indexfrom (-I), search, rolling, synclog
or compact.

By default, **squatter** creates an index of ALL messages in the
mailbox, not just those since the last time that it was run.  The
**-i** option is used to select incremental updates.  Any messages
appended to the mailbox after **squatter** is run, will NOT be
included in the index.  To include new messages in the index,
**squatter** must be run again, or on a regular basis via crontab, an
entry in the EVENTS section of cyrus.conf(5) or use *rolling* mode
(**-R**).

In the first synopsis, **squatter** indexes all mailboxes.

In the second synopsis, **squatter** indexes the specified
mailbox(es). The mailboxes are space-separated.

In the third synopsis, **squatter** indexes the specified user(s)
mailbox(es).

For the latter two index modes (mailbox, user) one may optionally
specify **-r** to recurse from the specified start, or **-a** to limit
action only to mailboxes which have the shared */vendor/cmu/cyrus-
imapd/squat* annotation set to "true".

In the fourth synopsis, **squatter** runs in rolling mode.  In this
mode **squatter** backgrounds itself and runs as a daemon (unless
**-d** is set), listening to a sync log channel chosen using the
**-n** option, and set up using the *sync_log_channels* setting in
imapd.conf(5).  Very soon after messages are delivered or uploaded to
mailboxes **squatter** will incrementally index the affected mailbox
(see notes, below).

In the fifth synopsis, **squatter** reads a single sync log file and
performs incremental indexing on the mailbox(es) listed therein.  This
is sometimes useful for cleaning up after problems with rolling mode.

In the sixth synopsis, **squatter** reads *file* containing *mailbox*
*uid* tuples and performs indexing on the specified messages.

In the seventh synopsis, **squatter** will compact indices from
*srctier(s)* to *desttier*, optionally reindexing (**-X**) or
filtering expunged records (**-F**) in the process.  The optional
**-T** flag may be used to specify a directory to use for temporary
files.  The **-o** flag may be used to direct that a single index be
copied, rather than compacted, from *srctier* to *desttier*.  The
**-u** flag may be used to restrict operation to the specified
user(s).

For all modes, the **-S** option may be specified, causing squatter to
pause *seconds* seconds after each mailbox, to smooth loads.

Note: Incremental updates are very inefficient with the SQUAT search
  engine.  If using SQUAT for large and active mailboxes, you should
  run **squatter** periodically as an EVENT in "cyrus.conf(5)".

Note: Messages and mailboxes that have not been indexed CAN still be
  SEARCHed, just not as quickly as those with an index.

**squatter** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-a

   Only create indexes for mailboxes which have the shared
   */vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/squat* annotation set to "true".

   The value of the */vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/squat* annotation is
   inherited by all children of the given mailbox, so an entire
   mailbox tree can be indexed (or not indexed) by setting a single
   annotation on the root of that tree with a value of "true" (or
   "false").  If a mailbox does not have a */vendor/cmu/cyrus-
   imapd/squat* annotation set on it (or does not inherit one), then
   the mailbox is not indexed. In other words, the implicit value of
   */vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/squat* is "false".

-d

   In rolling mode, don't background and do emit log messages on
   standard error.  Useful for debugging. This feature was introduced
   in version 3.0.

-F

   In compact mode, filter the resulting database to only include
   messages which are not expunged in mailboxes with existing
   name/uidvalidity. This feature was introduced in version 3.0.

-f synclogfile

   Read the *synclogfile* and incrementally index all the mailboxes
   listed therein, then exit. This feature was introduced in version
   3.0.

-h

   Display this usage information.

-I file

   Read from *file* and index individual messages described by
   mailbox/uid tuples contained therein.

-i

   Incremental updates where indexes already exist.

-N name

   Only index mailboxes beginning with *name* while iterating through
   the mailbox list derived from other options.

-n channel

   In rolling mode, specify the name of the sync log *channel* that
   **squatter** will listen to.  The default is "squatter".  This
   channel **must** be defined in imapd.conf(5) before being used.
   This feature was introduced in version 3.0.

-o

   In compact mode, if only one source database is selected, just copy
   it to the destination rather than compacting. This feature was
   introduced in version 3.0.

-R

   Run in rolling mode; **squatter** runs as a daemon listening to a
   sync log channel and continuously incrementally indexing mailboxes.
   See also **-d** and **-n**. This feature was introduced in version
   3.0.

-r

   Recursively create indexes for all sub-mailboxes of the user,
   mailboxes or mailbox prefixes given as arguments.

-S seconds

   After processing each mailbox, sleep for "seconds" before
   continuing. Can be used to provide some load balancing.  Accepts
   fractional amounts. This feature was introduced in version 3.0.

-T directory

   When indexing, work on a temporary copy of the search engine
   databases in *directory*.  That directory would typically be on
   some very fast filesystem, like an SSD or tmpfs.  This option may
   not work with all search engines, but it's only effect is to speed
   up initial indexing. Xapian only. This feature was introduced in
   version 3.0.

-t srctier...

   In compact mode, the comma separated source tier(s) for the
   compacted indices.  At least one source tier must be specified in
   compact mode. Xapian only. This feature was introduced in version
   3.0.

-u

   Extra options refer to usernames (e.g. foo@bar.com) rather than
   mailbox names.  Usernames are space-separated. This feature was
   introduced in version 3.0.

-v

   Increase the verbosity of progress/status messages.  Sometimes
   additional messages are emitted on the terminal with this option
   and the messages are unconditionally sent to syslog.  Sometimes
   messages are sent to syslog, only if -v is provided.  In rolling
   and synclog modes, -vv sends even more messages to syslog.

-X

   Reindex all the messages before compacting.  This mode reads all
   the lists of messages indexed by the listed tiers, and re-indexes
   them into a temporary database before compacting that into place.
   Xapian only. This feature was introduced in version 3.0.

-z desttier

   In compact mode, the destination tier for the compacted indices.
   This must be specified in compact mode. Xapian only. This feature
   was introduced in version 3.0.


Examples
========

**squatter** is typically deployed via entries in cyrus.conf(5), in
either the DAEMON or EVENTS sections.

For the older SQUAT search engine, which offers poor performance in
rolling mode (-R) we recommend triggering periodic runs via entries in
the EVENTS section, as follows:

Sample entries from the EVENTS section of cyrus.conf(5) for periodic
**squatter** runs:

      EVENTS {
          # reindex changed mailboxes (fulltext) approximately every three hours
          squatter1   cmd="/usr/bin/ionice -c idle /usr/lib/cyrus/bin/squatter -i" period=180

          # reindex all mailboxes (fulltext) daily
          squattera   cmd="/usr/lib/cyrus/bin/squatter" at=0117
      }

For the newer Xapian search engine, and with sufficiently fast
storage, the rolling mode (-R) offers advantages.  Use of rolling mode
requires that **squatter** be invoked in the DAEMON section.

Sample entries for the DAEMON section of cyrus.conf(5) for rolling
**squatter** operation:

      DAEMON {
        # run a rolling squatter using the default sync_log channel "squatter"
        squatter cmd="squatter -R"

        # run a rolling squatter using a specific sync_log channel
        squatter cmd="squatter -R -n indexer"
      }

Note: When using the *-R* rolling mode, you MUST enable sync_log
  operation in imapd.conf(5) via the *sync_log: on* setting, and MUST
  define a sync_log channel via the *sync_log_channels:* setting.  If
  also using replication, you must either explicitly specify your
  replication sync_log channel via the *sync_log_channels* directive
  with a name, or specify the default empty name with "" (the two-
  character string U+22 U+22).  [Please see imapd.conf(5) for
  details].

Note: When configuring rolling search indexing on a **replica**, one
  must consider whether sync_logs will be written at all.  In this
  case, please consider the setting *sync_log_unsuppressable_channels*
  to ensure that the sync_log channel upon which one's squatter
  instance depends will continue to be written.  See imapd.conf(5) for
  details.

Note: When using the Xapian search engine, you must define various
  settings in imapd.conf(5).  Please read all relevant Xapian
  documentation in this release before using Xapian.

[NB: More examples needed]
