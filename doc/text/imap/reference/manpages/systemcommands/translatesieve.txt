**translatesieve**
******************

Translate sieve scripts to use unixhierarchysep and/or altnamespace.


Synopsis
========

   **translatesieve** [**-f**] [**-a**] [**-u**] [**-n**] [**-v**] [**-C** *imapd.conf*]


Description
===========

**translatesieve** can both translate the mailbox separator characters
in sieve scripts from traditional netnews style – ‘.’ – to new Unix
style – ‘/’ – and vice versa.  It can also convert sieve scripts to
use "altnamespace" mailbox naming conventions.  Please also see
Mailbox namespaces for details.

In its default mode, **translatesieve** assumes that the old
configuration used *both* "unixhierarchysep: no" and "altnamespace:
no".  If your configuration was already using one of these, then use
the appropriate flag, **-u** for "unixhierarchysep: yes" or **-a** for
"altnamespace: yes".  Failure to do so may ruin your sieve scripts.

A “Dry run” mode is available via **-n** and you are strongly
encouraged to use this.

**translatesieve** reads its configuration options out of the
imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.

Must be run as the cyrus user.


Options
=======

-f

   Keep going on errors.

-a

   Translate from a configuration which already used "altnamespace:
   yes".

-u

   Translate from a configuration which already used
   "unixhierarchysep: yes".

-n

   Dry-run mode.  No changes will be written, but you’ll be shown what
   would be changed.

-v

   Verbose mode.  Note: -n implies -v.

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).
