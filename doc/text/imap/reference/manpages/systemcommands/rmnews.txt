**********

Expunge and remove news articles


Synopsis
========

   **rmnews** [ **-C** *config-file* ]


Description
===========

**rmnews** reads article data from the standard input.  It then
expunges and removes the listed articles.  **rmnews** is designed to
be used by InterNetNews to remove canceled, superseded, and expired
news articles.

The input is processed as an INN *expirerm(8)* file listing or an INN
cancel stream written as a ``WC'' entry in the *newsfeeds(5)* file.
This data consists of lines of text, each containing a list of
relative article pathnames, with a single space between entries.  If a
listed file is contained in an IMAP news mailbox, it is expunged out
of that mailbox.  In any case, each listed file is unlinked.

**rmnews** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file unless specified otherwise by **-C**. The optional "newsprefix"
option specifies a prefix to be prepended to newsgroup names to make
the corresponding IMAP mailbox names.  The required "partition-news"
option specifies the pathname prefix to the IMAP news mailboxes.  The
value of "partition-news" concatenated with the dots-to-slashes-
converted value of "newsprefix" must be the pathname of the news spool
directory.


Options
=======

   default imapd.conf(5).
