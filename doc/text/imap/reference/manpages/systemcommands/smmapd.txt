**smmapd**
**********

Sendmail socket map daemon


Synopsis
========

   **smmapd** [ **-C** *config-file* ]  [ **-U** *uses* ] [ **-T** *timeout* ] [ **-D** ]


Description
===========

**smmapd** is a Sendmail socket map daemon which is used to verify
that a Cyrus mailbox exists, that it is postable and it is under
quota.  It accepts commands on its standard input and responds on its
standard output.  It MUST be invoked by master(8) with those
descriptors attached to a remote client connection.

**smmapd** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-U  uses

   The maximum number of times that the process should be used for new
   connections before shutting down.  The default is 250.

-T  timeout

   The number of seconds that the process will wait for a new
   connection before shutting down.  Note that a value of 0 (zero)
   will disable the timeout.  The default is 60.

-D

   Run external debugger specified in debug_command.
