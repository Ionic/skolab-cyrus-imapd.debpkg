intro


Synopsis
========

   **deliver** [ **-C** *config-file* ] [ **-d** ] [ **-r** *address* ]
          [ **-f** *address* ] [ **-m** *mailbox* ] [ **-a** *auth-id* ]
          [ **-q** ] [ *userid* ]...
   **deliver** [ **-C** *config-file* ] **-l**


Description
===========

**deliver** reads a message from the standard input and delivers it to
one or more IMAP mailboxes.

**deliver** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-d

   Ignored for compatability with **/bin/mail**.

-r  address

   Insert a **Return-Path:** header containing *address*.

-f  address

   Insert a **Return-Path:** header containing *address*.

-m  mailbox

   Deliver to **mailbox**.  If any *userid*s are specified, attempts
   to deliver to "user."*userid*".mailbox" for each *userid*. If the
   ACL on any such mailbox does not grant the sender the "p" right or
   if **-m** is not specified, then delivers to the INBOX for the
   *userid*, regardless of the ACL on the INBOX.

   If no *userid*s are specified, attempts to deliver to *mailbox*. If
   the ACL on *mailbox* does not grant the sender the "p" right, the
   delivery fails.

-a  auth-id

   Specify the authorization id of the sender.  Defaults to
   "anonymous".

-q  user-id

   Deliver message even when receiving mailbox is over quota.

-l

   Accept messages using the LMTP protocol.


NOTES
=====

Depending on the setting of "reject8bit" in imapd.conf(5), deliver
either rejects/accepts messages with 8-bit-set characters in the
headers. If we accept messages with 8-bit-set characters in the
headers, then depending on the setting of "munge8bit", these
characters are either left un-touched or changed to "X".

This is because such characters can't be interpreted since the
character set is not known, although some communities not well-served
by US-ASCII assume that those characters can be used to represent
characters not present in US-ASCII.

A method for encoding 8-bit-set characters is provided by **RFC
2047**.
