**********

Delete mail from IMAP mailbox or partition based on age or size


Synopsis
========

   **ipurge** [ **-f** ] [ **-C** *config-file* ] [ **-x** ] [ **-M** ] [ **-X** ] [ **-i** ] [ **-s** ] [ **-o** ] [ **-n** ] [ **-v** ]
           [ **-d** *days* | **-b** *bytes* | **-k** *Kbytes* | **-m** *Mbytes* ]
           [ *mailbox-pattern*... ]


Description
===========

*ipurge* deletes messages from the mailbox(es) specified by *Imailbox-
pattern* that are older or larger than specified by the **-d**,
**-b**, **-k** or **-m** options.  If no *mailbox-pattern* is given,
*ipurge* works on all mailboxes.  If the **-x** option is given, the
message age and size MUST match exactly those specified by **-d**,
**-b**, **-k** or **-m**.  The are no default values, and at least one
of **-d**, **-b**, **-k** or **-m** MUST be specified.

*Ipurge* by default only deletes mail below shared folders, which
means that mails in mailbox(es) below INBOX.* and user.* stay
untouched. Use the option **-f** to also delete mail in mailbox(es)
below these folders. Use the **-M** option to not recurse into the
mailboxes.

*ipurge* reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5) file
unless specified otherwise by **-C**.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-f

   Force ipurge to examine mailboxes below INBOX.* and user.*.

-d days

   Age of message in *days*.

-b bytes

   Size of message in *bytes*.

-k Kbytes

   Size of message in *Kbytes* (2^10 bytes).

-m Mbytes

   Size of message in *Mbytes* (2^20 bytes).

-x

   Perform an exact match on age or size (instead of older or larger).

-X

   Use delivery time instead of Date: header for date matches.

-i

   Invert match logic: -x means not equal, date is for newer, size is
   for smaller.

-s

   Skip over messages that have the \Flagged flag set.

-o

   Only purge messages that have the \Deleted flag set.

-n

   Only print messages that would be deleted (dry run).
