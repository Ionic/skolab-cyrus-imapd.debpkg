************

deny users access to Cyrus services


Synopsis
========

   **cyr_deny** [ **-C** *config-file* ] [ **-s** *services* ] [ **-m** *message* ] *user*
   **cyr_deny** [ **-C** *config-file* ] **-a** *user*
   **cyr_deny** [ **-C** *config-file* ] **-l**


Description
===========

**cyr_deny** is used to deny individual users access to Cyrus
services. The first synopsis denies user *user* access to Cyrus
services, the second synopsis allows access again.  **cyr_deny** works
by adding an entry to the Cyrus "user_deny.db" database; the third
synopsis lists the entries in the database.  The service names to be
matched are those as used in cyrus.conf(5).

**cyr_deny** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-a user

   Allow access to all services for user *user* (remove any entry from
   the deny database).

-s services

   Deny access only to the given *services*, which is a comma-
   separated list of wildcard patterns.  The default is "*" which
   denies access to all services.

-m message

   Provide a message which is sent to the user to explain why access
   is being denied.  A default message is used if none is specified.

-l

   List the entries in the deny database.
