History
=======

The xlist-*flag* settings existed for a while in Cyrus IMAP 2.4, for
setting special-use style flags for particular folder names (on a
server-wide basis). This was deprecated at some point with the
introduction of **RFC 6154**.

The **cvt_xlist_specialuse** tool was introduced in Cyrus IMAP 3.0 to
aid administrators in upgrading from older deployments where
xlist-*flag* settings had been in use.
