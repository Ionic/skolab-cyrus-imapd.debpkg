**arbitron**
************

Report readership statistics for mailboxes on the server.


Synopsis
========

   **arbitron** [ **-C** *config-file* ] [ **-o** ] [ **-u** ] [ **-l** ] [ **-p** *months* ]
            [ **-d** *days* | **-D** *mmddyyyy*[**:***mmddyyyy*] ] *mailbox*...


Description
===========

**arbitron** collects and reports readership statistics for mailboxes
on the server. It also optionally prunes the mailboxes of "\Seen"
state for dormant users.

**arbitron** produces one line of output per mailbox, reporting the
mailbox name followed by a space, followed by the number of readers
(and if **-u** is specified, followed by a colon and a comma-separated
list of the reader’s user IDs), and if **-o** is not specified,
another space and the number of subscribers (and if **-u** is
specified, followed by a colon and a comma-separated list of the
subscribers userids).

Important: This format is subject to change in future versions.

Each “reader” is a distinct authorization identity which has the s
right to the mailbox and which has **SELECT**ed the mailbox within
either the past **-d** *days* or the specified **-D**
*date*[**:***range*].

Users are not counted as reading their own personal mail‐boxes.
Personal mailboxes are not reported unless there is at least one
reader other than the mailboxes owner.

**arbitron** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-o

   Report “the old way” – not including subscribers.

-l

   Enable long reporting (comma delimited table consisting of mbox,
   userid, r/s, start time, end time).

-d days

   Count as a reader an authorization identity which has used the
   mailbox within the past *days* days.

-D mmddyyyy[:mmddyyyy]

   Count as a reader an authorization identity which has used the
   mailbox within the given date range.

   The start date and optionally the end date are specified as 2-digit
   month of the year, 2-digit day of the month, and 4-digit year.

   If the end date is not specified, the current system time will be
   used as the end time.

   Note: Please note that the date notation is American [*mmddyyyy*]
     not [*ddmmyyyy*].

-p months

   Prune "\Seen" state for users who have not used the mailbox within
   the past *months* months. The default is infinity.
