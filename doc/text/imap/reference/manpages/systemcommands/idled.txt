Synopsis
========

   **idled** [ **-C** *config-file* ]


Description

**idled** is a long lived datagram daemon which receives notifications
of mailbox changes and signals the appropriate **imapd** to report the
changes to the client.

**Idled** is usually started from master(8).

**idled** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).


Examples

**idled** is commonly included in the DAEMON section of cyrus.conf(5)
like so:

   DAEMON {
       idled                   cmd="/usr/lib/cyrus/bin/idled"
   }
