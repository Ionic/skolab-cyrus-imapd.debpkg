**notifyd**
***********

Cyrus notification server


Synopsis
========

   **notifyd** [ **-C** *config-file* ]  [ **-U** *uses* ] [ **-T** *timeout* ] [ **-D** ]


Description
===========

**notifyd** is a daemon started from master(8) that handles
notification requests on behalf of lmtpd(8). **Notifyd** accepts the
request and performs the notification using the method specified in
the request.

Note that for **notifyd** to run properly you must set "proto=udp" in
its cyrus.conf(5) services entry.  "prefork=1" is also recommended.

**notifyd** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.

"notifysocket" option is used to specify the Unix domain socket to
listen on for notifications.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-U  uses

   The maximum number of times that the process should be used for new
   connections before shutting down.  The default is 250.

-T  timeout

   The number of seconds that the process will wait for a new
   connection before shutting down.  Note that a value of 0 (zero)
   will disable the timeout.  The default is 60.

-D

   Run external debugger specified in debug_command.


NOTIFICATION METHODS
====================

**null**

   Ignore the notification request.

**log**

   Log the notification to syslog (for testing).

**mailto**

   Email the notification.  This method can ONLY be used in a Sieve
   ‘notify’ action as it requires a *mailto:* URL to be specified as
   an *:option*.

**zephyr**

   Send the notification as a zephyrgram.  If used in a Sieve ‘notify’
   action, additional recipients can be specified as *:options*.

**external**

   Send the notification via an external program.  The path to the
   program is specified using the *notify_external* option in the
   configuration file.
