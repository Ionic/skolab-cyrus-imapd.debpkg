**sync_reset**
**************

Account reset utility. DANGER.


Synopsis
========

   **sync_reset** [ **-C** *config-file* ] [ **-v** ] [ **-f** ]


Description
===========

**sync_reset** is a small utility program to destroy user accounts on
a system.  The only safeguard which is in place is the obligatory
force option.

**sync_reset** reads its configuration options out of the
imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-v

   Verbose mode.

-f

   Force operation. Without this flag **sync_reset** just bails out
   with an error.  Principally here to try and prevent accidents with
   command autorepeat.


Files
=====

/etc/imapd.conf
