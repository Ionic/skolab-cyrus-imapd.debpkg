***********************

Perform operations on the conversations databases


Synopsis
========

   **ctl_conversationsdb** [ -C *config-file* ] **-d** *userid* > text
   **ctl_conversationsdb** [ -C *config-file* ] **-u** *userid* < text
   **ctl_conversationsdb** [ -C *config-file* ] [ **-v** ] [ **-z** | **-b** | **-R** ] *userid*
   **ctl_conversationsdb** [ -C *config-file* ] [ **-v** ] [ **-z** | **-b** | **-R** ] **-r**


Description
===========

**ctl_conversationsdb** is used to perform various administrative
operations on a conversations database and associated information in
*cyrus.index* files.

**ctl_conversationsdb** reads its configuration options out of the
imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.

The *configdirectory* option in imapd.conf(5) is used to determine the
default location of the conversations database.

In the first synopsis, the **-d** option dumps the contents of a
conversations database to standard output in an ASCII format.  In the
second synopsis, the resulting *file* is fed back in, using the **-u**
option to "undump" from standard input.  This pair of commands is
useful for disaster recovery, or for changing the backend used to
store the conversations database.

The third synopsis is used to reconstruct conversations information in
various ways for a specific user, and the fourth to reconstruct
conversations information for all users.  See "OPTIONS" below for
details.

This command was introduced in version 3.0.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-d userid

   Dump the conversations database which corresponds to the user
   *userid* to standard output in an ASCII format.  The resulting file
   can be used to recreate a database using the **-u** option.

-u userid

   "Undumps" the conversations database corresponding to the user
   *userid*, i.e. replaces all the entries with data from ASCII
   records parsed from standard input.  The output from the **-d**
   option can be used as input.

-v

   Be more verbose when running.

-r

   Be recursive; apply the main operation to every user.  Warning: do
   not combine with **-u**, it will not do what you expect.

-z

   Remove all conversation information from the conversations database
   for user *userid*, and from all the user's mailboxes.  The
   information can all be recalculated (eventually) from message
   headers, using the **-b** option.

-b

   Rebuild all conversation information in the conversations database
   for user *userid*, and in all the user's mailboxes, from the header
   information in messages.  Does not affect messages which already
   have conversation information.

   This is a bulk mode version of what happens to each message when it
   arrives, and can be used to add missing conversation information
   for past messages, e.g. after using **-z** or after upgrading Cyrus
   from older versions.  Note: this operation uses information from
   *cyrus.cache* files so it does not need to read every single
   message file.

-R

   Recalculate counts of messages stored in existing conversations in
   the conversations database for user *userid*.  This is a limited
   subset of **-b**; in particular it does not create conversations or
   assign messages to conversations.
