Synopsis
========

   **mbtool** [ **-C** *config-file* ] **-r** *mailbox*...
   **mbtool** [ **-C** *config-file* ] **-t** *mailbox*...


Description
===========

**mbtool** is a tool for performing various actions on the indexes of
a list of mailboxes. The only actions currently supported are **-t**,
which will normalize the "internaldate" time stamp of each record in
the index to GMT, and **-r** which will create a new unique ID for
each mailbox.

Only one action may be given and at least mailbox must be listed.

It is intended that **mbtool** will be extended over time to perform
more such actions.

**mbtool** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-t

   Normalize "internaldate" on all index records of all listed
   *mailbox*es to match the *Date:* header if they're off by more than
   a day, which can be used to fix up a mailbox which has been
   restored from backup and lost its internaldate information.

-r

   Create a new unique ID for all listed *mailbox*es.


Examples
========

   **mbtool -r** user.jsmith

   Create new UUID for mailbox *user.jsmith*.

   **mbtool -t** user.jsmith

   Normalize "internaldate" on all index records in *user.jsmith*.


Files
=====
