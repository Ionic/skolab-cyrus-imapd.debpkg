**relocate_by_id**
******************

Relocate mailbox trees by their mailbox ids


Synopsis
========

   **relocate_by_id** [ **-C** *config-file* ] [ **-n** ] [ **-q** ] [ **-u** ] [ *mailbox-names*... ]


Description
===========

Given a mailbox name or a space separated list of mailbox names,
**relocate_by_id** relocates the mailbox and its submailboxes to
directory trees hashed by mailbox id rather than hashed by mailbox
name.

**relocate_by_id** reads its configuration options out of the
imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by **-C**. It uses
<configdirectory>/mailboxes.db to locate the mailboxes on disk.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-n

   Do NOT make any changes.  Just list which directories will be
   relocated.

-q

   Run quietly.  Suppress any error output.

-u

   The specified *mailbox-names* are users, not mailboxes. User
   metadata directories will also be relocated.


Examples
========

   **relocate_by_id -u** *jsmith*

   Relocate all mailbox and metadata directories for user *jsmith*.


Files
=====

/etc/imapd.conf, <configdirectory>/mailboxes.db
