Description
===========

**sync_client** is the client side of the replication system.  It runs
on the client (master) system and connects to the target (replica)
system and generates an appropriate sequence of transactions to
synchronize the replica system with the master system.

**sync_client** reads its configuration options out of the
imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-A

   All users mode. Sync every user on the server to the replica
   (doesn’t do non-user mailboxes at all… this could be considered a
   bug and maybe it should do those mailboxes independently)

-d delay

   Minimum delay between replication runs in rolling replication mode.
   Larger values provide better efficiency as transactions can be
   merged. Smaller values mean that the replica system is more up to
   date and that you don’t end up with large blocks of replication
   transactions as a single group. Default: 3 seconds.

-f input-file

   In mailbox or user replication mode: provides list of users or
   mailboxes to replicate.  In rolling replication mode, specifies an
   alternate log file (**sync_client** will exit after processing the
   log file).

-F shutdown-file

   Rolling replication checks for this file at the end of each
   replication cycle and shuts down if it is present. Used to request
   a nice clean shutdown at the first convenient point. The file is
   removed on shutdown. Overrides "sync_shutdown_file" option in
   imapd.conf(5).

-l

   Verbose logging mode.

-L

   Perform only local mailbox operations (do not do mupdate
   operations). This feature was introduced in version 3.0.

-m

   Mailbox mode. Remaining arguments are list of mailboxes which
   should be replicated.

-n channel

   Use the named channel for rolling replication mode.  If multiple
   channels are specified in "sync_log_channels" then use one of them.
   This option is probably best combined with **-S** to connect to a
   different server with each channel.

-N

   Use non-blocking sync_lock (combination of IP address and username)
   to skip over any users who are currently syncing.

-o

   Only attempt to connect to the backend server once rather than
   waiting up to 1000 seconds before giving up.

-O

   No copyback mode. Replication will stop if the replica reports a
   CRC error, rather than doing a full mailbox sync. Useful if moving
   users to a new server, where you don’t want any errors to cause the
   source servers to change the account.

-p partition

   In mailbox or user replication mode: provides the name of the
   partition on the replica to which the mailboxes/users should be
   replicated.

-r

   Rolling (repeat) replication mode. Pick up a list of actions
   recorded by the lmtpd(8), imapd(8), pop3d(8) and nntpd(8) daemons
   from the file specified in "sync_log_file". Repeat until
   "sync_shutdown_file" appears.

-1

   Like rolling replication, but only process a single file before
   exiting.

-s

   Sieve mode. Remaining arguments are list of users whose Sieve files
   should be replicated. Principally used for debugging purposes: not
   exposed to sync_client(8).

-S servername

   Tells **sync_client** with which server to communicate.  Overrides
   the "sync_host" configuration option.

-t timeout

   Timeout for single replication run in rolling replication.
   **sync_client** will negotiate a restart after this many seconds.
   Default: 600 seconds

-u

   User mode. Remaining arguments are list of users who should be
   replicated.

-v

   Verbose mode.  Use twice (**-v -v**) to log all protocol traffic to
   stderr.

-w interval

   Wait this long before starting. This option is typically used so
   that we can attach a debugger to one end of the replication system
   or the other.

-z

   Require compression. The replication protocol will always try to
   enable deflate compression if both ends support it.  Set this flag
   when you want to abort if compression is not available.


Examples
========

On a replication master, the following would be added to the START
section of cyrus.conf(5):

      syncclient              cmd="/usr/lib/cyrus/bin/sync_client -r"

[NB: More examples needed]


History
=======

The **-L** feature, local updates only, was added in version 3.0.
