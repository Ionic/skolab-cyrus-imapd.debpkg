**quota**
*********

Report and optionally fix storage and message quota usage.


Synopsis
========

   **quota** [ **-C** *config-file* ] [ **-d** *domain* ] [ **-f** ] [ **-u** ] [ *mailbox-spec*... ]


Description
===========

**quota** generates a report listing quota roots, giving their limits
and usage.

If the **-f** option is specified, **quota** first fixes any
inconsistencies in the quota subsystem, such as mailboxes with the
wrong quota root or quota roots with the wrong quota usage reported.

If an optional *domain* is specified with the **-d** option, the quota
listing (and any inconsistency fixing) is performed only in that
domain rather than all mailboxes.

If one or more *mailbox-spec* arguments are specified, these are
interpreted as mailbox prefixes, and the quota listing (and
inconsistency fixing) is limited to quota roots with names that start
with one of the given prefixes. If the **-u** is provided, *mailbox-
spec* arguments are instead interpreted as userids, and the quota
listing (and inconsistency fixing) is limited to quota roots for only
the specified users.

Warning: Running **quota** with both the **-f** option and *mailbox-
  spec* arguments is not recommended.

**quota** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-d domain

   List and/or fix quota only in *domain*.

-f

   Fix any inconsistencies in the quota subsystem before generating a
   report.

-n

   Check for any inconsistencies in the quota subsystem but don’t
   actually fix them.  Use with **-f** and **-q** to only see what’s
   incorrect.

-q

   Operate quietly. If **-f** is specified, then don’t print the quota
   values, only print messages when things are changed.

-J

   Output the quota values as JSON for automated tooling support

-u

   Interpret *mailbox-spec* arguments as userids.  The default is to
   interpret them as mailbox prefixes

mailbox-spec

   Only report and/or fix quota in mailboxes matching the specified
   *mailbox-spec* arguments.  See also **-u**.
