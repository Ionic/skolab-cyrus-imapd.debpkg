**quota**
*********

Report and optionally fix storage and message quota usage.


Synopsis
========

   **quota** [ **-C** *config-file* ] [ **-d** *domain* ] [ **-f** ] [ *mailbox-prefix*... ]


Description
===========

**quota** generates a report listing quota roots, giving their limits
and usage.

If the **-f** option is specified, **quota** first fixes any
inconsistencies in the quota subsystem, such as mailboxes with the
wrong quota root or quota roots with the wrong quota usage reported.

If an optional *domain* is specified with the **-d** option, the quota
listing (and any inconsistency fixing) is performed only in that
domain rather than all mailboxes.

If one or more *mailbox-prefix* arguments are specified, the quota
listing (and inconsistency fixing) is limited to quota roots with
names that start with one of the given prefixes.

Warning: Running **quota** with both the **-f** option and *mailbox-
  prefix* arguments is not recommended.

**quota** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-d domain

   List and/or fix quota only in *domain*.

-f

   Fix any inconsistencies in the quota subsystem before generating a
   report.

-q

   Operate quietly. If **-f** is specified, then don't print the quota
   values, only print messages when things are changed.

-J

   Output the quota values as JSON for automated tooling support

mailbox-prefix

   Only report and/or fix quota in mailboxes starting with the
   specified *mailbox-prefix*.


Examples
========

   List quotas for all users and mailboxes.
