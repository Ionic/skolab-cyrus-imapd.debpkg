**mkimap**
**********

A (small) Perl script to aid in creating spool and configuration
directories for Cyrus IMAP installations.


Synopsis
========

   **mkimap** *config-file*


Description
===========

The **mkimap** script reads in the configuration file specified on the
command-line or uses "/etc/imapd.conf" to determine a list of
directories that Cyrus IMAP would need to operate.

Among these directories are:

   * the "configdirectory" (from imapd.conf(5))

   * the "partition-$name" directories (from imapd.conf(5))

   * the "meta-partition-$name" directories (from imapd.conf(5))

Note: This utility needs to be executed as the user "cyrus" (or the
  user you run the Cyrus IMAP service as).


Options
=======

config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).


Examples
========

   **mkimap** */etc/imapd.conf*

   Create necessary directories based on settings in
   */etc/imapd.conf*.
