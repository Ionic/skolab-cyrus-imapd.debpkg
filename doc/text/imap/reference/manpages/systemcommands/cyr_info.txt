Description
===========

**cyr_info** is a tool for getting information from Cyrus.  The intent
is to extend this tool with useful commands to make managing and
configuring Cyrus easier.

**cyr_info** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.

**cyr_info** provides the following sub-commands:

conf

   Print the configuration options which have been set to a value
   other than their default, and their value.

   With **-s version**, configuration options whose behaviour has
   changed since *version* will be highlighted.

conf-all

   Print ALL configuration options and their configured values
   (including those using their default value).  This command shows
   which options will be in effect at runtime.

   With **-s version**, configuration options which have been added or
   whose behaviour has changed since *version* will be highlighted.

conf-default

   Print the default values for all available configuration options.

   With **-s version**, configuration options which have been added or
   whose behaviour has changed since *version* will be highlighted.

conf-lint

   Print only configuration options which are NOT recognised.  This
   command should not print anything.  It uses cyrus.conf to find the
   names of configured services to avoid displaying any known
   configuration options for the named service.

proc

   Print all currently connected processes in the proc directory


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-M config-file

   Read service specifications from *config-file* (cyrus.conf format).

-n servicename

   Read the configuration as if for the service named *name*.

-s version

   Highlight configuration options that have been added or whose
   behaviour has been modified since *version*.  Use this option after
   a server upgrade, specifying your previous version, to find which
   options you need to review and maybe change before starting up the
   upgraded server.

   For use with the **conf**, **conf-all**, and **conf-default** sub-
   commands.


Examples
========

   **cyr_info** *proc*

   List all the proc files and who theyâ€™re logged in as.

   **cyr_info** *conf-lint*

   Lint the configuration for unrecognized settings.

This command was introduced in version 3.0.
