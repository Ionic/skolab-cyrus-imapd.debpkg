General cyrus inspection tool


Synopsis
========

   **cyr_info** [OPTIONS] conf

   **cyr_info** [OPTIONS] conf-all
   **cyr_info** [OPTIONS] conf-lint
   **cyr_info** [OPTIONS] proc


Description
===========

**cyr_info** is a tool for getting information from Cyrus.  The intent
is to extend this tool with useful commands to make managing and
configuring Cyrus easier.

**cyr_info** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.

**cyr_info** provides the following sub-commands:

conf

   Print only the configuration options which are not the same as
   default (regardless of whether you have specified them or not).

conf-default

   Print all default configuration options, ignoring those set
   locally.

conf-all

   Print ALL configuration options - including default options.  This
   command shows which options will be in effect at runtime.

conf-lint

   Print only configuration options which are NOT recognised.  This
   command should not print anything.  It uses cyrus.conf to find the
   names of configured services to avoid displaying any known
   configuration options for the named service.

proc

   Print all currently connected processes in the proc directory


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-M config-file

   Read service specifications from *config-file* (cyrus.conf format).

-n servicename

   Read the configuration as if for the service named *name*.


Examples
========

   **cyr_info** *proc*

   List all the proc files and who they're logged in as.

   **cyr_info** *conf-lint*

   Lint the configuration for unrecognized settings.


History
=======

This command was introduced in version 3.0.


Files
=====

/etc/imapd.conf, /etc/cyrus.conf
