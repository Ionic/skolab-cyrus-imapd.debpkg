**rehash**
**********

rehash checks and rehashes Cyrus directories based on the hashing
settings in the imapd.conf.

Use in the event you choose to change your hashing settings. For more
information on directory hashing, see the documentation on Directory
Hashing.


Synopsis
========

   **rehash** [**-v**] [**-n**] [**-f**|**-F**] [**-i**|**-I**] imapd.conf


Description
===========

**rehash** fixes the hashing on Cyrus directories.

It should be safe to run rehash on a running system, but it may mess
things up horribly if you have some processes still running with old
config, and some with new - so it is always recommended to fully shut
down Cyrus, change the configuration file, run rehash, and then start
Cyrus again.


Options
=======

imapd.conf

   imapd.conf must always be provided.  On a normal system this will
   be /etc/imapd.conf.  The correct hashing settings will be read from
   the provided imapd.conf, or can be overridden with options.

-v

   In -v verbose mode, each rename command will be printed, as well as
   any creation or deletion of folders.

-n

   In -n "no change" mode, it will just print the changes.  Note,
   verbose is always turned on in no-change mode.

-f | -F

      -f forces fulldirhash: no
      -F forces fulldirhash: yes

-i | -I

      -i forces hashimapspool: no
      -I forces hashimapspool: yes


Files
=====
