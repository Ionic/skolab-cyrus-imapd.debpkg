NNTP server process


Synopsis
========

   **nntpd** [ **-C** *config-file* ] [ **-U** *uses* ] [ **-T** *timeout* ] [ **-D** ]
       [ **-s** ] [ **-r** ] [ **-f** ] [ **-p** *ssf* ]


Description
===========

**nntpd** is an NNTP server. It accepts commands on its standard input
and responds on its standard output. It MUST invoked by master(8) with
those descriptors attached to a remote client connection.

**nntpd** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.  The optional "newsprefix"
setting specifies a prefix to be prepended to newsgroup names to make
the corresponding IMAP mailbox names.  The optional "newspostuser"
setting specifies the special userid to be used when constructing the
*To:* header address for following up to articles when read via IMAP.
The optional "newspeer" setting specifies the fully qualified hostname
of the upstream news server to which articles are fed.  The optional
"allownewnews" setting enables the NNTP NEWNEWS command.

Note: For servers with a large volume of articles, the NEWNEWS
  command can be expensive.

If the directory "<configdirectory>/log/"*user* exists, then **nntpd**
will create protocol telemetry logs for sessions authenticating as
*user*. The telemetry logs will be stored in the "log/"*user*
directory with a filename of the **nntpd** process-id.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-U  uses

   The maximum number of times that the process should be used for new
   connections before shutting down.  The default is 250.

-T  timeout

   The number of seconds that the process will wait for a new
   connection before shutting down.  Note that a value of 0 (zero)
   will disable the timeout.  The default is 60.

-D

   Run external debugger specified in debug_command.

-s

   Serve NNTP over SSL (https).  All data to and from **nntpd** is
   encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer.

-r

   Only allow NNTP reader commands.  Permitted clients will only be
   allowed to read/post articles.

-f

   Only allow NNTP feeder commands.  Permitted clients will only be
   allowed to feed articles (no reading).

-p  ssf

   Tell **nntpd** that an external layer exists.  An *SSF* (security
   strength factor) of 1 means an integrity protection layer exists.
   Any higher SSF implies some form of privacy protection.
