**cyr_sequence**
****************

Debug tool for seqset. Also useful for resolving sequences.


Synopsis
========

   **cyr_sequence** [ **-C** *altconfig* ] [ **-m** *maxval* ] <command> *sequence*

   The *command* is one of:

       * parsed
       * compress
       * members
       * ismember
       * create

   The *sequence* is a list of sequences. Discrete numbers are separated with commas, ranges are separated by colons.


Description
===========

**cyr_sequence** shows what happens when various operations are
performed over a sequence.


Options
=======

parsed *sequence*

   Dumps a parsed view of the list structure, broken into contiguous
   sections.

compress *sequence*

   Given a list, compress ranges with colons.

members *sequence*

   Displays the full list of members within the sequence, in order,
   expanding out the ranges.

ismember *[num...]*

   For each number in the list, check if it’s in the sequence.

create *[-s] [-o origlist] [items]*

   Generate a new list from the items, prefix numbers with "~" to
   remove them from the list. If an original list is given, this is
   joined into this new list.

   The *-s* flag generates a sparse list.

join *sequence1* *sequence2*

   Join two sequences together and return the output in compressed
   format.

-C *altconfig*

   Specify an alternate config file.

-m *maxval*

   Limit the maximum value to accept.


Examples
========

   **cyr_sequence parsed 1,3,4,5**

   **cyr_sequence compress 1,3,4,5**

   **cyr_sequence members 1,23:25,28,30:32**
