**backupd**
***********

Cyrus Backups server process


Synopsis
========

   **backupd** [ **-C** *config-file* ] [ **-U** *uses* ] [ **-T** *timeout* ] [ **-D** ]
       [ **-s** ] [ **-N** ] [ **-p** *ssf* ]


Description
===========

**backupd** is the Cyrus Backups server.  It accepts Cyrus replication
protocol commands on its standard input and responds on its standard
output.  It MUST be invoked by master(8) with those descriptors
attached to a replication client connection, typically sync_client(8).

**backupd** reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
file unless specified otherwise by **-C**.

**backupd** is generally configured to run on a dedicated backup
server, containing backup storage, but no IMAP service or mailbox
storage.

You must configure at least one *backuppartition*.  User backups will
be distributed among the configured partitions.  Note that there is no
relationship between mailbox partitions and *backuppartitions*.

If the directory "log"/*user* exists under the directory specified in
the "configdirectory" configuration option, then **backupd** will
create protocol telemetry logs for sessions authenticating as *user*.
The telemetry logs will be stored in the "log"/*user* directory with a
filename of the **backupd** process-id.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-U  uses

   The maximum number of times that the process should be used for new
   connections before shutting down.  The default is 250.

-T  timeout

   The number of seconds that the process will wait for a new
   connection before shutting down.  Note that a value of 0 (zero)
   will disable the timeout.  The default is 60.

-D

   Run external debugger specified in debug_command.

-p  ssf

   Tell **backupd** that an external layer exists.  An *SSF* (security
   strength factor) of 1 means an integrity protection layer exists.
   Any higher SSF implies some form of privacy protection.


Examples
========

**backupd** is commonly included in the SERVICES section of
cyrus.conf(5) like so:

   SERVICES {
       **backupd        cmd="backupd" listen="csync" prefork=0**
   }
