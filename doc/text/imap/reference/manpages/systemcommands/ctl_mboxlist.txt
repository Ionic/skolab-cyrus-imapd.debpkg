Perform operations on the mailbox list database


Synopsis

   **ctl_mboxlist** [ **-C** *config-file* ] **-d** [ **-x** ] [**-y**] [ **-p** *partition* ] [ **-f** *filename* ]
   **ctl_mboxlist** [ **-C** *config-file* ] **-u** [ **-f** *filename* ]
   **ctl_mboxlist** [ **-C** *config-file* ] **-m** [ **-a** ] [ **-w** ] [ **-i** ] [ **-f** *filename* ]
   **ctl_mboxlist** [ **-C** *config-file* ] **-v** [ **-f** *filename* ]


Description
===========

**ctl_mboxlist** is used to perform various administrative operations
on the mailbox list database.

**ctl_mboxlist** reads its configuration options out of the
imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by **-C**. The
*configdirectory* option in imapd.conf(5) is used to determine the
default location of the mailboxes database.


Options
=======

-C config-file

   Use the specified configuration file *config-file* rather than the
   default imapd.conf(5).

-d

   Dump the contents of the database to standard output in a portable
   flat-text format.  NOTE: In Cyrus versions 2.2.13 and earlier, the
   dump format did not include the mailbox type flags, breaking remote
   mailboxes (frontends, mupdate master, unified backends) when
   undumped.

-x

   When performing a dump, remove the mailboxes dumped from the
   mailbox list (mostly useful when specified with **-p**).

-y

   When performing a dump, also list intermediary mailboxes which
   would be hidden from IMAP.

-p partition

   When performing a dump, dump only those mailboxes that live on
   *partition*.

-f filename

   Use the database specified by *filename* instead of the default
   (*configdirectory/mailboxes.db**).

-u

   Load the contents of the database from standard input.  The input
   MUST be in the format output by the **-d** option.

Note: Both the old and new formats can be loaded, but the old format
  will break remote mailboxes.

-m

   For backend servers in the Cyrus Murder, synchronize the local
   mailbox list file with the MUPDATE server.

-a

   When used with **-m**, assume the local mailboxes file is
   authoritative, that is, only change the mupdate server, do not
   delete any local mailboxes.

Important: USE THIS OPTION WITH CARE, as it allows namespace
  collisions into the murder.

-w

   When used with **-m**, print out what would be done but do not
   perform the operations.

-i

   When used with **-m**, asks for verification before deleting local
   mailboxes.

-v

   Verify the consistency of the mailbox list database and the spool
   partition(s). Mailboxes present in the database and not located on
   a spool partition, and those located on a spool partition
   (directory containing a valid cyrus.header file) and not present in
   the database will be reported.  Note that this function is very I/O
   intensive.


Examples
========

   **ctl_mboxlist -d**

   Dump the mailboxes list in portable text format.

   **ctl_mboxlist -u** < *newmboxlist.dump*

   Undump (restore) the mailboxes database from *newmboxlist.dump*, a
   portable text formatted file.

   **ctl_mboxlist -m**

   Synchronize our mailboxes database with the MUPDATE server.  (One
   may commonly put a command like this into the **START** section of
   cyrus.conf(5) on backend nodes of a Murder cluster to cause the
   backend to synchronize its mailbox list with the mupdate master
   upon startup).

   **ctl_mboxlist -m -w**

   The same as above, but only show us what would be done, donâ€™t
   actually do it.

   **ctl_mboxlist -m -a**

   Populate the Mupdate server from our copy of the mailboxes
   database.

   Note: Be very careful with this option, as it can create
     conflicts in the Murder.

   **ctl_mboxlist -m -i**

   Synchronize our mailboxes database with the MUPDATE server
   interactively, asking for verification before deleting any local
   mailboxes.
