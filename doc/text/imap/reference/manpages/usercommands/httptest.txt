**httptest**
************

Interactive HTTP test program.

This is actually installed as a hard linked copy of imtest(1).

It allows you to authenticate and send HTTP commands to the server.

Description
===========

**imtest** is a utility that allows you to authenticate to a IMAP or
IMSP server and interactively issue commands to it. Once authenticated
you may issue any IMAP or IMSP command by simply typing it in. It is
capable of multiple SASL authentication mechanisms and handles
encryption layers transparently. This utility is often used for
testing the operation of a imsp or imap server. Also those developing
IMAP clients find it useful.


Options
=======

-t  keyfile

   Enable TLS.  *keyfile* contains the TLS public and private keys.
   Specify **""** to negotiate a TLS encryption layer but not use TLS
   authentication.

-p  port

   Port to connect to. If left off this defaults to **imap** as
   defined in "/etc/services".

-m  mechanism

   Force **imtest** to use *mechanism* for authentication. If not
   specified the strongest authentication mechanism supported by the
   server is chosen.  Specify *login* to use the LOGIN command instead
   of AUTHENTICATE.

-a  userid

   Userid to use for authentication; defaults to the current user.
   This is the userid whose password or credentials will be presented
   to the server for verification.

-u  userid

   Userid to use for authorization; defaults to the current user. This
   is the userid whose identity will be assumed after authentication.

   Note: This is only used with SASL mechanisms that allow proxying
     (e.g. PLAIN, DIGEST-MD5).

-k  num

   Minimum protection layer required.

-l  num

   Maximum protection layer to use (**0**=none; **1**=integrity; etc).
   For example if you are using the KERBEROS_V4 authentication
   mechanism specifying **0** will force imtest to not use any layer
   and specifying **1** will force it to use the integrity layer.  By
   default the maximum supported protection layer will be used.

-r  realm

   Specify the *realm* to use. Certain authentication mechanisms (e.g.
   DIGEST-MD5) may require one to specify the realm.

-f  file

   Pipe *file* into connection after authentication.

-n  num

   Number of authentication attempts; default = 1.  The client will
   attempt to do SSL/TLS session reuse and/or fast reauth (e.g.
   DIGEST-MD5), if possible.

-s

   Enable SSL over chosen protocol.

-q

   Enable IMAP COMPRESSion (after authentication).

-c

   Enable challenge prompt callbacks.  This will cause the OTP
   mechanism to ask for the one-time password instead of the secret
   pass-phrase (library generates the correct response).

-i

   Don't send an initial client response for SASL mechanisms, even if
   the protocol supports it.

-I  file

   Echo the PID of the running process into *file* (This can be useful
   with -X).

-v

   Verbose. Print out more information than usual.

-z

   Timing test.

-x  file

   Open the named socket for the interactive portion.

-X  file

   Like -x, only close all file descriptors & daemonize the process.

-w passwd

   Password to use (if not supplied, we will prompt).

-o  option=value

   Set the SASL *option* to *value*.
