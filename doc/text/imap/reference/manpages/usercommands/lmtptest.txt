Interactive LMTP test program


Synopsis
========

   **lmtptest** [ **-t** *keyfile* ] [ **-p** *port* ] [ **-m** *mechanism* ]
       [ **-a** *userid* ] [ **-u** *userid* ] [ **-k** *num* ] [ **-l** *num* ]
       [ **-r** *realm* ] [ **-f** *file* ] [ **-n** *num* ] [ **-c** ] [ **-i** ]
       [ **-v** ] [ **-w** *passwd* ] [ **-o** *option*=*value* ] *hostname*


Description
===========

This is actually installed as a hard link to imtest(1).

**lmtptest** is a utility that allows you to authenticate to a LMTP
server and interactively issue commands to it. Once authenticated you
may issue any LMTP command by simply typing it in. It is capable of
multiple SASL authentication mechanisms and handles encryption layers
transparently. This utility is often used for testing the operation of
a lmtp server. Also those developing LMTP clients find it useful.


Options
=======

-t  keyfile

   Enable TLS.  *keyfile* contains the TLS public and private keys.
   Specify **""** to negotiate a TLS encryption layer but not use TLS
   authentication.

-p  port

   Port to connect to. If left off this defaults to **lmtp** as
   defined in "/etc/services".

-m  mechanism

   Force **lmtptest** to use *mechanism* for authentication. If not
   specified the strongest authentication mechanism supported by the
   server is chosen.  Specify *login* to use the LOGIN command instead
   of AUTHENTICATE.

-a  userid

   Userid to use for authentication; defaults to the current user.
   This is the userid whose password or credentials will be presented
   to the server for verification.

-u  userid

   Userid to use for authorization; defaults to the current user. This
   is the userid whose identity will be assumed after authentication.

   Note: This is only used with SASL mechanisms that allow proxying
     (e.g. PLAIN, DIGEST-MD5).

-k  num

   Minimum protection layer required.

-l  num

   Maximum protection layer to use (**0**=none; **1**=integrity; etc).
   For example if you are using the KERBEROS_V4 authentication
   mechanism specifying **0** will force imtest to not use any layer
   and specifying **1** will force it to use the integrity layer.  By
   default the maximum supported protection layer will be used.

-r  realm

   Specify the *realm* to use. Certain authentication mechanisms (e.g.
   DIGEST-MD5) may require one to specify the realm.

-f  file

   Pipe *file* into connection after authentication.

-n  num

   Number of authentication attempts; default = 1.  The client will
   attempt to do SSL/TLS session reuse and/or fast reauth (e.g.
   DIGEST-MD5), if possible.

-c

   Enable challenge prompt callbacks.  This will cause the OTP
   mechanism to ask for the the one-time password instead of the
   secret pass-phrase (library generates the correct response).

-i

   Don't send an initial client response for SASL mechanisms, even if
   the protocol supports it.

-v

   Verbose. Print out more information than usual.

-w passwd

   Password to use (if not supplied, we will prompt).

-o  option=value

   Set the SASL *option* to *value*.
