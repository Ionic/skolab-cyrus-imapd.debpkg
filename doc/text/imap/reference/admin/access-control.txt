Discretionary Access Control
============================

Cyrus IMAP employs discretionary access control, meaning that users
themselves are in charge of what folders are shared, and with whom.

Two means exist to suppress sharing folders between users:

1. Revoke the a (administration) right on all mailboxes in the
   personal namespace for each user.

2. Suppress the listing of the Other Users Namespace by enabling
   "disable_user_namespace" in imapd.conf(5).
