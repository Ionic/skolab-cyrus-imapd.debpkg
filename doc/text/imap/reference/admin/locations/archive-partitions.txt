Archive Partitions
******************

Archive partitions are defined by the "archivepartition-name" option
in imapd.conf(5):

   "archivepartition-name:" <none>

      The pathname of the archive partition *name*, corresponding to
      spool partition **partition-name**.  For any mailbox residing in
      a directory on **partition-name**, the archived messages will be
      stored in a corresponding directory on **archivepartition-
      name**. Note that not every **partition-name** option is
      strictly required to have a corresponding **archivepartition-
      name** option, but that without one there’s no benefit to
      enabling archiving.

As is the case with metadata partitions, however, archive partitions
do not stand alone.  They are closely bound to Spool Directories as
defined by the accompanying "partition-name" directive.

Multiple partitions may be used for various reasons, such as to
distribute load between different storage pools or technologies.
Please consult Mail Spool Partitions for more details and use cases.

To define additional mail spools, add more "partition-name" entries to
imapd.conf(5) as needed.  For example, let’s imagine we want to
migrate users to new partitions split by first character of the user’s
last name, and add a partition for shared mailboxes (see Shared
Namespaces):

* Sample:

     defaultpartition: main
     partition-main: /var/spool/cyrus
     partition-am: /var/spool/cyrus-am
     partition-nz: /var/spool/cyrus-nz
     partition-shared: /var/spool/cyrus-shared

So, to add archiving to the system described above, we would need
something like this (again, building on our previous examples):

* Sample:

     defaultpartition: main
     partition-main: /var/spool/cyrus
     partition-am: /var/spool/cyrus-am
     partition-nz: /var/spool/cyrus-nz
     partition-shared: /var/spool/cyrus-shared
     archive_enabled: yes
     archivepartition-main: /var/spool/cyrusarchive/main
     archivepartition-am: /var/spool/cyrusarchive/am
     archivepartition-nz: /var/spool/cyrusarchive/nz
     archivepartition-shared: /var/spool/cyrusarchive/shared
