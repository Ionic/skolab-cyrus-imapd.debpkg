Cyrus Socket Locations
**********************

The Cyrus IMAP server provides service interfaces via either TCP/IP
ports or Unix domain sockets.  For the later, Cyrus requires the
parent directory exist prior to initialization.

The following sockets may be required for any host providing local
Unix domain access for the listed services, where "<rundir>" is the
base directory for Cyrus sockets. This defaults to
"{configdirectory}/socket/" where {configdirectory} is as defined in
imapd.conf(5), but is often redefined as "/var/run/cyrus/socket/" or
more recently "/run/cyrus/socket/":

   lmtp      <rundir>/lmtp   # Lightweight Mail Transport Protocol service
   idle      <rundir>/idle   # idled daemon socket
   notify    <rundir>/notify # Notification daemon socket
   ptloader  <rundir>/ptsock # PT Loader socket (alternative authorization)


Controlling Socket Locations
============================

Locations of sockets may be tailored to the needs of different sites,
via the use of several settings in imapd.conf(5):

   "idlesocket:" {configdirectory}/socket/idle

      Unix domain socket that idled listens on.

   "lmtpsocket:" {configdirectory}/socket/lmtp

      Unix domain socket that lmtpd listens on, used by deliver(8).
      This should match the path specified in cyrus.conf(5).

   "notifysocket:" {configdirectory}/socket/notify

      Unix domain socket that the mail notification daemon listens on.

   "ptloader_sock:" <none>

      Unix domain socket that ptloader listens on. (defaults to
      configdirectory/ptclient/ptsock)
