Alternative Namespace

Switching the Alternative Namespace
===================================

When switching the alternative namespace configuration variable in
imapd.conf(5), bear in mind that client applications might conclude
folders to have been removed and to have been added, as opposed to
having been moved, resulting in a complete download of all folders and
messages.
