Cyrus Murder
************

The Cyrus Murder provides the ability to horizontally scale your Cyrus
IMAP environment across multiple servers. It is similar in nature to
various proxy solutions such as nginx or perdition with the difference
being that Murder offers a uniform namespace. Those not currently
using shared mailboxes and who donâ€™t intend to use shared mailboxes in
the future, should probably just consider using a simple proxy
solution.
