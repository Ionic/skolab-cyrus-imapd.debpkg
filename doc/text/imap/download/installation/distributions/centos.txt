CentOS
******

Currently supported versions of CentOS include Cyrus IMAP packages in
the repositories configured on a stock system:

* Cyrus IMAP 2.3.7 for CentOS 5

* Cyrus IMAP 2.3.16 for CentOS 6

* Cyrus IMAP 2.4.17 for CentOS 7

Note: The Cyrus project does not support running any versions of the
  Cyrus IMAP software older than the version of the software shipped
  with the operating system itself.

To install the version of Cyrus IMAP that comes with the operating
system, issue the following command:

   # **yum install cyrus-imapd cyrus-sasl cyrus-sasl-plain**

Next, set a password for the default administrative user "cyrus":

   # **passwd cyrus**
   Changing password for user cyrus.
   New password:
   Retype new password:
   passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

Start and configure to start when the system boots, the *saslauthd*
service:

   # **service saslauthd start**
   Starting saslauthd:                                        [  OK  ]
   # **chkconfig saslauthd on**

You should at this moment be able to authenticate against *saslauthd*:

   # **testsaslauthd -u cyrus -p YOUR-PASSWORD**

You should get an "0: OK "Success."" message.

Start the service, and ensure the service starts up when the system
boots:

   # **service cyrus-imapd start**
   # **chkconfig cyrus-imapd on**

You should now be able to login as the "cyrus" user, which is
configured by default as an administrator for Cyrus IMAP:

   # **imtest -t "" -u cyrus -a cyrus localhost**
