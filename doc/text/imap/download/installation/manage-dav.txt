HTTP modules
************


About http module support
=========================

This assumes you already have the relevant modules enabled in your
Cyrus installation, either via packages, or through a manual
installation.

CalDAV, CardDAV and WebDAV all provide their functionality through an
http server. Cyrus HTTP is NOT a general purpose HTTP server (such as
Apache httpd). Its feature set is limited to:

* Calendaring (CalDAV)

     * Acts as a calendar and scheduling server by using IMAP
       mailboxes as calendar collections and **RFC 5322** messages to
       store iCalendar data.

     * Allows non-CalDAV/remote calendar clients to query freebusy
       information of Cyrus CalDAV users via freebusy URLs.

     * Allows scheduling transactions between separate calendaring
       and scheduling systems via the iSchedule protocol (currently
       only used within a Cyrus Murder).

     * Acts as a Time Zone Distribution Service by serving iCalendar
       (VTIMEZONE) data to client systems.

* Contacts (CardDAV)

     * Acts as a contacts server by using IMAP mailboxes as
       addressbook collections and **RFC 5322** messages to store
       vCard data.

* File Storage (WebDAV)

     * Acts as a remote storage server server by using IMAP
       mailboxes as collections and **RFC 5322** message to store
       files.

* JMAP support

     * Allows synchronization of mail clients via the JSON Mail
       Access Protocol (JMAP).

* Other (RSS, static content)

     * Serves static content (such as the RSS feed list template and
       the CalDAV/CardDAV web GUIs).

     * Serves IMAP mailboxes as RSS feeds.


HTTPD Configuration
===================


General configuration
---------------------

The Cyrus httpd service is configured using options in imapd.conf(5).


httpmodules
^^^^^^^^^^^

   "httpmodules:" <empty string>

      Space-separated list of HTTP modules that will be enabled in
      httpd(8).  This option has no effect on modules that are
      disabled at compile time due to missing dependencies (e.g.
      libical).

      Note that “domainkey” depends on “ischedule” being enabled, and
      that both “freebusy” and “ischedule” depend on “caldav” being
      enabled. Allowed values: *admin*, *caldav*, *carddav*, *cgi*,
      *domainkey*, *freebusy*, *ischedule*, *jmap*, *prometheus*,
      *rss*, *tzdist*, *webdav*

The support for RSS, CalDAV, and CardDAV is divided into separate
modules which run as part of the Cyrus httpd service. Selection of
which module(s) are enabled is done by setting the "httpmodules"
option. **By default, no modules are enabled.**

Cyrus httpd also can serve static content, the location of which is
set by the "httpdocroot" option. Any content contained in the
specified directory (including sub-directories) will be served as
static content only. Cyrus httpd does NOT have the ability to execute
any server-side scripts.


Authentication
--------------

As with other Cyrus services, the Cyrus httpd service uses *Cyrus
SASL* to perform its authentication.


allowplaintext
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   *This shows the default value: change it in imapd.conf to suit your
   needs.*

   "allowplaintext:" 0

      If enabled, allows the use of cleartext passwords on the wire.

      By default, the use of cleartext passwords requires a TLS/SSL
      encryption layer to be negotiated prior to any cleartext
      authentication mechanisms being advertised or allowed.  To
      require a TLS/SSL encryption layer to be negotiated prior to ANY
      authentication, see the *tls_required* option.

Similar to plaintext login commands supported by the other Cyrus
services (IMAP LOGIN, POP3 USER/PASS), the Cyrus httpd service
determines whether to advertise the HTTP Basic authentication scheme
based on the "allowplaintext" option and whether the client has
connected over a TLS protected connection (HTTPS). BASIC
authentication does not depend on a Cyrus SASL plugin.

The advertisement of the other HTTP authentication schemes is
controlled by the *SASL mech_list option* option. For Cyrus httpd the
DIGEST-MD5, GSS-SPNEGO, NTLM, SCRAM-SHA-1, and SCRAM-SHA-256 values
enable support for the Digest, Negotiate (Kerberos only), NTLM, SCRAM-
SHA-1, and SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication schemes respectively, provided
that the plugins are installed on the server.

For end users
=============

Some information must be passed on to your end users so that they know
how to configure their clients in order to access their data on Cyrus.
The list below needs to be customized to your specific hostnames.

* CalDAV

     * Many clients find calendars automatically if you provide the
       correct server, username and password.

     * Otherwise, use the direct URL:
       "https://<servername>/dav/calendars/user/<userid>/<calendar>/"

* Freebusy

     * "https://<servername>/freebusy/user/<userid>" - considers all
       CalDAV collections of the user

     * "https://<servername>/freebusy/user/<userid>/<collection-
       name>" - considers a single CalDAV collection

     * Query parameters can be added to the URL per Section 4 of
       Freebusy Read URL.

* CardDAV

     * Many clients find addressbooks automatically if you provide
       the correct server, username and password.

     * Otherwise, use the direct
       URL:"https://<servername>/dav/addres
       sbooks/<userid>/<addressbook>"

     * The address book(s) are automatically filtered based on the
       username and password supplied.

* WebDAV

     * "https://<servername>/dav/drive/user/<userid>"

* RSS

     * "https://<servername>/rss/"

     * Serves up all mailboxes (read-only) that the authenticated
       user has access to.
