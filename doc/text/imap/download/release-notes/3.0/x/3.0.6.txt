Changes Since 3.0.5
===================


Experimental features
---------------------

The experimental JMAP support has been removed in 3.0.6.  The JMAP
specification has changed substantially since 3.0.0 was released, in
ways that cannot be simply backported.

If you wish to experiment with or contribute to Cyrus JMAP support,
please check out the unstable 3.1.x release tags, or the git master
branch.


Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed Issue #2177: murder frontends using TLS no longer crash on
  starttls failure (thanks Wolfgang Breyha)

* Fixed Issue #2197: warnings fixed in CYRUS-MASTER.mib (thanks
  Fabrice Bacchella)

* Fixed: squatter(8) no longer crashes when conversations are not
  enabled

* Fixed Issue #2301: rolling-mode squatter now works correctly from
  cyrus.conf(5) DAEMON section

* Fixed some compilation warnings in the Xapian wrapper

* Fixed capabilities detection in imtest(1) (thanks Pavel Zhukov)

* Fixed Issue #2253: master(8) now rejects service entries with
  listen paths that are too long

* Fixed Issue #2303: lmtpd(8) now looks for sieve scripts in the
  same directories as the rest of cyrus (including timsieved(8)).
  Please note that if you had manually installed sieve scripts to the
  directories lmtpd used to look in, these will need to be moved.

* Fixed build failure with LibreSSL 2.7 (thanks Bernard Spil)

* Fixed Issue #2317: sieve variables now work correctly in
  mailboxexists tests

* Fixed: squatter manpage now installs correctly when SQUAT engine
  not in use (thanks uutari)

* Fixed: recover from certain IMAP parse errors without losing
  protocol sync


Other changes
-------------

* Services will now syslog warnings about attempts to access
  nonexistent partitions

* reconstruct(8) now accepts a *-I* argument to enable updating of
  mailbox UNIQUEIDs when clashes are detected, and will not do so
  without. This is useful for preventing problems like Issue #2240 in
  replicated environments.
