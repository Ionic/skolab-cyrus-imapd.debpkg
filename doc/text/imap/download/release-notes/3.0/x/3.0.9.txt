New configuration options
-------------------------

* The new "cyrus_group" option in imapd.conf(5) can be used to set
  the UNIX group that Cyrus processes run as (thanks Jakob Gahde).

  "cyrus_user". The old "--with-cyrus-group" configure option has been
  non- functional for many years, and has been removed.
