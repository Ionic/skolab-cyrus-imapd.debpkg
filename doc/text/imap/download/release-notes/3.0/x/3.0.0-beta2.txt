Major changes since the 2.5.x series
====================================

* Support added for FastMail-style conversations (threaded
  messages). (See the "conversations" options in imapd.conf)

* Optional Xapian integration for faster and shinier search. Note
  that this requires custom patches to Xapian, in this release. (See
  the "search_engine" option in imapd.conf, and "doc/README.xapian" in
  the source distribution.))

* Archive support has arrived! Requires addition of an archive
  partition. (See "archive_*" options in imapd.conf)

* Basic JMAP support. (See "httpmodules" in imapd.conf)

* Optional ClamAV integration for AntiVirus support is now working
  again. Requires separate installation of ClamAV. (See configure.ac "
  --with-clamav=DIR")

* Dropped support for Berkeley DB.

* The handling of configure options has changed, dropping support
  for "--with-cyrus-prefix" and "--with-service-path" in favour of the
  more conventional "--prefix", "--bindir", "--sbindir", and "--
  libexecdir".

* Binaries executed by the master(8) service process are now
  installed to "--libexecdir".  Other binaries are installed to "--
  bindir" and/or "--sbindir".

  The "make installbinsymlinks" target can be used to set up symlinks
  to everything in "--bindir", if you need that in your environment.

* Added support for replicating mailboxes/users to a particular
  partition.  "sync_client" now accepts a "-p" option.

* The "defaultdomain" setting in imapd.conf now defaults to
  “internal” (was: NULL)

* Added experimental backup service.  See "docs/install-backup.html"
  in the source distribution for preliminary
  installation/configuration/administration documentation.

* Support for Apple’s Push service (XAPPLEPUSH).  See Cyrus
  Eventsource

* Sieve now supports special use folders.  See Cyrus Sieve

* New numeric header available for sorting: X-Spam-Score

* Added IMIP notification support to notifyd(8).  See "imipnotifier"
  in imapd.conf

* Optimised CRC32 implementation

* Added support for reverse ACLs, enabling faster LIST response.
  See "reverseacls" in imapd.conf

* Added cross-domain sharing support.  See "crossdomains" and
  "crossdomains_onlyother" in imapd.conf

* Added experimental object storage for mail data, with preliminary
  support for OpenIO and Caringo backends.  See configure.ac "--
  enable-objectstore", and the "object_storage_*", "openio_*" and
  "caringo_*" options in imapd.conf.

* Configurable POP3 UIDL format for compatibility with other mail
  servers.  Supports Courier Mail Server and Dovecot formats, in
  addition to Cyrus formats.  See "uidl_format" in imapd.conf

* Sieve now supports the **RFC 5490** Checking Mailbox Status and
  Accessing Mailbox Metadata extensions.  See "sieve_extensions" in
  imapd.conf

* Under "delete_mode: delayed", only the 20 most recently deleted
  mailboxes are kept for any given name.


Significant bugfixes
====================

* Lots of fixes to caldav and carddav.

  Includes the addition of a new daemon (calalarmd) which periodically
  processes a global database containing the “next” alarm for each
  item, and sends the relevant mboxevents. (See configure.ac "--with-
  calalarmd")

* Replication reliability fixes.

* Improved "LIST-EXTENDED": more imap tests now succeed.

* Extensive cleanup of mailbox name handling

* "master" now requests a sane maximum number of open file
  descriptors, and only complains if this isn’t allowed.

* Fixes to compiling on Solaris (thanks Jens Erat, Marty Lee)

* Improved handling of mailbox renames during replication
