Security fixes
--------------

* Fixed CVE-2019-19783: When creating a missing mailbox as part of a
  sieve 'fileinto' directive, lmtpd would create it as administrator,
  bypassing ACL checks.

  lmtpd creates missing mailboxes as part of a sieve 'fileinto'
  directive if:

  * (2.5+) the *anysievefolder* option is enabled (default: not), or

  * (3.0+) the *sieve_extensions* option has the 'mailbox' extension
    enabled (default: enabled) and the 'fileinto' directive contains
    the ":create" argument

  Under these conditions, a user with the ability to upload a custom
  sieve script to their account could use it to create any valid
  mailbox on the server (with ACL inherited from the parent mailbox as
  usual).

  lmtpd no longer creates these mailboxes as administrator, so users
  may no longer use a 'fileinto' directive to create a mailbox they
  couldn't create otherwise.


Build changes
-------------

* *configure --disable-http2* can now be used to disable HTTP/2
  support, even when libnghttp2 is installed on the system (thanks
  Дилян Палаузов)


Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed Issue #2383: XFER of a single mailbox now works (thanks
  Anthony Prades)

* Fixed Issue #2914: *ctl_backups lock* no longer crashes if the
  backup is already locked

* Fixed Issue #2913: errors are now logged when
  *maxlogins_per_host*, *maxlogins_per_user*, and *popminpoll* limits
  are reached (thanks Sergey)

* Fixed: various IOERRORs resulting from bad handling of files >2GB

* Fixed Issue #2920: backup tools now expect admin namespace
  mboxnames, not internal names

* Fixed Issue #2931: symbol ordering in libcyrus.so no longer
  depends on shell locale in effect during compilation (thanks Xavier)
