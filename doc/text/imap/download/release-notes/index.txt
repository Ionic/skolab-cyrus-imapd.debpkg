Release Notes
*************

Cyrus has switched to an odd-even release cycle.

With our versioning system using "major.minor.micro" numbering, the
minor number reveals whether a version is stable (even), or
development-only (odd).

A 3.0.1 release is stable, but a 3.1.4 release is developmental only.


Stable Version
==============

Latest stable version is . Documentation at
https://www.cyrusimap.org/3.0/.


Development Version
===================

Warning: These are tagged snapshots of the master branch, and should
  be considered for **testing purposes** and **bleeding-edge
  features** only. We will try to tag these snapshots at coherent
  development points, but there will generally be **large breaking
  changes** occurring between releases in this series.
