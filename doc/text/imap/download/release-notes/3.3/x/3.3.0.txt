**************************

Unavailable for download as this is a development branch only.

Access is via git.

Warning: This should be considered for **testing purposes** and
  **bleeding- edge features** only. We will try to tag these snapshots
  at coherent development points, but there will generally be **large
  breaking changes** occurring between releases in this series.


Major changes since the 3.2 series
==================================

* DAV improvements

* Improved performance for users with large folders

* LITERAL- maximum size is now honoured (**RFC 7888**)

* Support for the ESORT (but not CONTEXT) extension from **RFC
  5267**

* Experimental JMAP for Sieve Scripts support (requires
  *jmap_nonstandard_extensions: yes* in imapd.conf(5)).

* Experimental Handling Message Disposition Notification with JMAP
  support (requires *jmap_nonstandard_extensions: yes* in
  imapd.conf(5)).

* Experimental JMAP Backup extension (requires
  *jmap_nonstandard_extensions: yes* in imapd.conf(5)).

* Experimental JMAP Notes extension (requires
  *jmap_nonstandard_extensions: yes* in imapd.conf(5)).

* Experimental JMAP Blob extension (requires
  *jmap_nonstandard_extensions: yes* in imapd.conf(5)).

* Experimental JMAP Mail extension (requires
  *jmap_nonstandard_extensions: yes* in imapd.conf(5)).

* New cyrus.index format v17 adds changes_epoch field, needed by
  JMAP Backups extension

* New *reverseuniqueids* imapd.conf(5) option (default on), which
  improves performance for users with large mailboxes

* Further improvements to the *reverseacls* imapd.conf(5)
  performance option

* Improvements to replication reliability and performance

* Experimental vnd.cyrus.log, vnd.cyrus.jmapquery, and
  vnd.cyrus.snooze Sieve extensions

* Improvements to conversations

* New *mailbox_maxmessages_addressbook*,
  *mailbox_maxmessages_calendar*, and *mailbox_maxmessages_email*
  imapd.conf(5) options for providing server-wide limits on the amount
  of objects in any one mailbox, independently of quotas.  These
  default to *0* (unlimited) for backward compatibility, but are
  highly recommended for protecting your server from misbehaving
  clients.

* New IMAP create/delete behaviour based on draft-ietf-extra-
  imap4rev2: mailboxes containing child mailboxes can no longer be
  deleted; and when creating mailboxes, ancestors will be created as
  needed.

* CRC32 optimisations


Updates to default configuration
================================

The cyr_info(8) *conf*, *conf-all* and *conf-default* subcommands
accept an *-s <version>* argument to highlight imapd.conf(5) options
that are new or whose behaviour has changed since the specified
version.  We recommend using this when evaluating a new Cyrus version
to check which configuration options you will need to examine and
maybe set or change during the process.

* None so far


Security fixes
==============

* None so far


Significant bugfixes
====================

* Fixed: Sieve Editheader Extension (**RFC 5293**) now works
  correctly with respect to section 7, Interaction with Other Sieve
  Extensions.
