DAV Collection Management
*************************

Calendars and addressbooks are maintained as “Collections” within the
Cyrus mail store.  They appear as mailboxes within the hierarchy, as
set by the "calendarprefix:" option in imapd.conf(5) (default is
"#calendars"), but should rarely be directly accessed or created using
either cyradm(8) or other mailbox-centric tools.

Collections have special attributes, so should be created and
maintained either through protocol – i.e. with purpose-built calendar
or address book clients – or with the provided web GUI.
