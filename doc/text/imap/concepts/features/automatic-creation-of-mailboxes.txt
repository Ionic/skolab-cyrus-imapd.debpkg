Automatic Creation of Mailboxes
*******************************

Cyrus IMAP features the ability to create mailboxes automatically;

* for successful login events,

* for email messages that arrive for a user,

* when a Sieve script uses the "fileinto" action.

When operating an IT infrastructure, Cyrus IMAP may only be one part
of such larger environment. When adding a user *John Doe
<john.doe@example.org>*, several pieces may need to fall or put in
place to ensure the account is fully functional.

Cyrus IMAP allows the automatic creation of John's INBOX, and selected
sub-folders, either when John first logs in to Cyrus IMAP, or when the
first message is to be delivered to John's INBOX.

Additional features of this functionality include;

* the automatic creation of a Sieve script for Server Side Filtering
  (Sieve).

* setting a storage quota and message quota for the user,

* automatic subscription to folders in the Personal Namespace,

* automatic subscription to a selection of or all shared folders.

Important: Third party solutions incorporating Cyrus IMAP, and
  distributors of Cyrus IMAP (such as your Linux distribution) may
  have disabled this functionality altogether, during the building of
  the packages -- most likely because they employ different means to
  get user's mailboxes created.Cyrus IMAP does not currently strip
  options from man-pages that are rendered irrelevant by the
  functionality not being built in, so while the man-page on your
  system may refer to settings related to this functionality, the
  actual functionality may not be available.

To enable the automatic creation of mailboxes, set the following
options in imapd.conf(5).

   "autocreate_quota:" -1

      If set to a value of zero or higher, users have their INBOX
      folders created upon a successful login event or upon *lmtpd(8)*
      message delivery if *autocreate_post* is enabled, provided their
      INBOX did not yet already exist.

      The user's quota is set to the value if it is greater than zero,
      otherwise the user has unlimited quota.

      Note that quota is specified in kilobytes.

   "autocreate_post:" 0

      If enabled, when *lmtpd(8)* receives an incoming mail for an
      INBOX that does not exist, then the INBOX is automatically
      created by *lmtpd(8)* and delivery of the message continues.

Other settings in imapd.conf(5) affecting automatic options.


Autocreation of mailboxes
=========================

   "autocreate_inbox_folders:" <none>

      If a user does not have an INBOX already, and the INBOX is to be
      created, create the list of folders in this setting as well.
      *autocreate_inbox_folders* is a list of INBOX's subfolders
      separated by a "|", that are automatically created by the server
      under the following two scenarios. Leading and trailing
      whitespace is stripped, so "Junk | Trash" results in two
      folders: "Junk" and "Trash".  See also the *xlist-flag* option,
      for setting special-use flags on autocreated folders.

      INBOX folders are created under both the following conditions:

      1. The user logins via the IMAP or the POP3 protocol.
         *autocreate_quota* option must have a value of zero or
         greater.

      2. A message arrives for the user through the *lmtpd(8)*.
         *autocreate_post* option must be enabled.


Automatic quota settings
========================

   "autocreate_quota_messages:" -1

      If set to a value of zero or higher, users who have their INBOX
      folders created upon a successful login event (see
      *autocreate_quota*), or upon *lmtpd(8)* message delivery if
      *autocreate_post* is enabled, receive the message quota
      configured in this option.

      The default of -1 disables assigning message quota.

      For consistency with *autocreate_quota*, a value of zero is
      treated as unlimited message quota, rather than a message quota
      of zero.


Autocreation of Sieve scripts
=============================

   "autocreate_sieve_folders:" <none>

      A "|" separated list of subfolders of INBOX that will be
      automatically created, if requested by a sieve filter, through
      the "fileinto" action. The default is to create no folders
      automatically.

      Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from each folder, so
      a setting of "Junk | Trash" will create two folders: "Junk" and
      "Trash".

   "autocreate_sieve_script:" <none>

      The full path of a file that contains a sieve script. This
      script automatically becomes a user's initial default sieve
      filter script.

      When this option is not defined, no default sieve filter is
      created. The file must be readable by the Cyrus daemon.

   "autocreate_sieve_script_compile:" 0

      If set to yes and no compiled sieve script file exists, the
      sieve script which is compiled on the fly will be saved in the
      file name that autocreate_sieve_compiledscript option points to.
      In order a compiled script to be generated,
      autocreate_sieve_script and autocreate_sieve_compiledscript must
      have valid values

   "autocreate_sieve_script_compiled:" <none>

      The full path of a file that contains a compiled in bytecode
      sieve script. This script automatically becomes a user's initial
      default sieve filter script.  If this option is not specified,
      or the filename doesn't exist then the script defined by
      autocreate_sieve_script is compiled on the fly and installed as
      the user's default sieve script


Automated folder subscriptions
==============================

   "autocreate_subscribe_folders:" <none>

      A list of folder names, separated by "|", that the users get
      automatically subscribed to, when their INBOX is created. These
      folder names must have been included in the
      autocreateinboxfolders option of the imapd.conf.

   "autocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders:" <none>

      A list of shared folders (bulletin boards), separated by "|",
      that the users get automatically subscribed to, after their
      INBOX is created. The shared folder must have been created and
      the user must have the required permissions to get subscribed to
      it. Otherwise, subscribing to the shared folder fails.

   "autocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders_all:" 0

      If set to yes, the user is automatically subscribed to all
      shared folders, one has permission to subscribe to.


Autocreation of users
=====================

   "autocreate_users:" anyone

      A space separated list of users and/or groups that are allowed
      their INBOX to be automatically created.

See imapd.conf(5) for the full documentation of all options.

Limitations to the Automatic Creation of Mailboxes
--------------------------------------------------

1. A user may in fact be able to successfully login to IMAP with
   both a full primary recipient email address such as
   "john.doe@example.org", as well as a secondary recipient email
   address such as "jdoe@example.org".

   Unless a process known as login username canonification is used,
   this could result in two different mailbox hierarchies being
   created;

   * "user/john.doe@example.org"

   * "user/jdoe@example.org"

2. When a user *Jane Gi <jane.gi@example.org>* marries *John Doe*
   and adopts her new husband's surname, her primary recipient email
   address may change to become "jane.doe@example.org".

   Note that *John Doe* does not need to be an "example.org" user for
   such event to occur, and that many countries allow the husband to
   take the maiden name of their spouse instead -- so even if the
   employees and/or associates of an organization running Cyrus IMAP
   are exclusively male, this may still apply to that organization.

   The functionality stated in this document does **not** rename
   "user/jane.gi@example.org" to become "user/jane.doe@example.org".
