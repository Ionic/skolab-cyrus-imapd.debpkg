Overview of Cyrus development environment
*****************************************


The pre-requisites
==================

While Cyrus itself can be run under many operating systems, we
recommend the following operating systems for development, because the
dependencies and libraries are known. If you get a development
environment working under a different operating system, we'd love to
hear about it.
   * Debian / Ubuntu

   * Fedora / Redhat


The components
==============


Source
------

Cyrus IMAPd
   Can't do anything without this!

   Follow the Cyrus IMAP installation guide.

Cyrus SASL
   Used for providing user authentication to the mail server.

   When developing against Cyrus, however, we assume that Cyrus SASL
   is a third party pre-built component. There is a separate section
   on compiling from source if you're interested in *contributing to
   Cyrus SASL*.
