About Cyrus Works
=================

Cyrus Works is a domain redirection to the Cyrus IMAP project's Travis
CI dashboard.

Whenever the Cyrus team push changes to the project repository, Travis
CI (via github integration) automatically builds the new commits.
This also applies to pull requests submitted through the GitHub site.


How it works
============

Cassandane, the Cyrus IMAP test framework gets pulled in to the Docker
Container, confirms existing functionality still works and no
regression bugs have been introduced.
