Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.4.9

      * fixed handling of unparsable emails during append (which would
        cause invalid cyrus.index records otherwise) 
      * quota: fix a pile of bugs. #1801, virtdomain support; #2728, slow
        user delete; #3178, "file name too long" with big mailbox names;
        #3179, quota -f doubles usage.

      * Bug #3158 - lmtp backend connection timeout 
      * Bug #3223 - limit MIME parsing depth to avoid stack overflows

        delivery to avoid backscatter 
      * sync_client: fix broken keepalive TCP options (I doubt anyone ever
        tried to use it) 
      * Bug #3482 - add "-o" option to ipurge to only purge messages with
        \Deleted flag set
