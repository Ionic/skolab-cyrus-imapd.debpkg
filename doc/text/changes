Changes in 3.0.0-beta1

Major changes

      * 
        Support added for FastMail-style conversations (threaded messages).
        (See the conversations options in imapd.conf) 
      * 

        Optional Xapian integration for faster and shinier search. Note
        that this requires custom patches to Xapian, in this release. (See
        the search_engine option in imapd.conf) 
      * 

        Archive support has arrived! Requires addition of an archive
        partition. (See archive_* options in imapd.conf) 
      *

      * 

        Optional ClamAV integration for AntiVirus support is now working
        again. Requires separate installation of ClamAV. (See configure.ac

      * 

        Dropped support for Berkeley DB.

        The handling of configure options has changed, dropping support for
        --with-cyrus-prefix and --with-service-path in favour of the more
        conventional --prefix, --bindir, --sbindir, and --libexecdir. 
      * 

        Binaries executed by the cyrus-master(8) service process are now
        installed to --libexecdir. Other binaries are installed to --bindir
        and/or --sbindir. 

        The make installbinsymlinks target can be used to set up symlinks
        to everything in --bindir, if you need that in your environment.
