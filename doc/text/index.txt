What is Cyrus SASL?
*******************

Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a specification
that describes how authentication mechanisms can be plugged into an
application protocol on the wire. Cyrus SASL is an implementation of
SASL that makes it easy for application developers to integrate
authentication mechanisms into their application in a generic way.

The latest stable version of Cyrus SASL is 2.1.27.
